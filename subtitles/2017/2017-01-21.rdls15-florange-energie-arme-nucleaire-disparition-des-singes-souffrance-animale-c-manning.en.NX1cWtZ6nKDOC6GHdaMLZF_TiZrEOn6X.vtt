00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
Hi folks!

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.020
This is Weekly Review #15, and time flew for me too!

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.980
I'm on the train.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.040
We left Florange, and we're on the train from Metz to Paris right now.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.900
I haven't had a minute to film all this today,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.580
but I do it anyway because we have to keep making one video a week.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.400
I was in Florange where we had a public meeting last night.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.880
I think it was an important event for me this week,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.240
because it was the first time I ever did a meeting in three  parts.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.700
I did the first part outside, because there were people there, and I just couldn't leave them outside and not...

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.460
—not only greet them, but I also wanted to spend some time with them,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.660
because I was told that the apparent temperature was -15°C!

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.240
I guarantee you that I must have talked outside for around 20 minutes and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480
I was as cold as an ice cube,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.680
and when I did the second part of the speech in the hallway,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.160
it felt like being in a soft cocoon compared to when I was outside.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.060
And then I finished my speech in the hall.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.040
It was an important event to me, because Florange is a symbol.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.180
It is the martyr region of our country.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.560
The Fensch valley was the heart of the French steel industry.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.840
But we know what is left of it after authorities repeatedly gave up on the French steel industry—we all know it!

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.440
This is a long story, and a beautiful one, because the steel industry is a real culture in the Fensch valley.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.600
But from a larger point of view, it is a horrible story that tells how the measures of the EU are a dead end,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.100
and that shows the gap between what they say and what they do.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.540
ArcelorMittal—it's called ArcelorMittal.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.820
It is composed of the Indian group Mittal and of Arcelor.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.460
Arcelor was the joint venture of a large European productive apparatus.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.500
It was supposed to become the equivalent of Airbus in the steel industry.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm not going to explain to you why  there won't ever be an Airbus again as it was at the time,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.580
but it's because Europe forbids anticipated payments and state subsidies which allowed Airbus to exist.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.900
Anyway, the case of Arcelor is even more lamentable, because one day a tender offer was made

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.000
—a tender offer is the purchase of a company by another.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It is called a hostile takeover when a company tries to acquire another company by force

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.900
although the company that is for sale doesn't want to be sold.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.620
So that's how it happened.
Mr. Mittal bought Arcelor, which became Arcelor-Mittal

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.900
And of course, he did what all big companies always do in those cases,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.840
they change order books, they merge production units, etc etc.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.400
Everyone follows this from afar, and it's normal, no one really understands the steel industry

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.880
but when you look at it closely,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.360
you clearly see that the steel industry is a typically cyclic industry.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.340
Sometimes, you need a lot of steel, and sometimes a lot less.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.340
And for this you need to...

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.380
—and since a huge amount of capital assets is tied to these sites,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.040
finances have to be sturdy to withstand those variations.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.020
When the drop is too high, an ordinary entrepreneur has to close his company or sell it for a lower price.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.880
But that's a problem when there's an increase in steel demand.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.560
It regularly happens in the steel industry and ArcelorMittal was no exception.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.560
Anyway, Florange is a place that was wrecked by all these decisions,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.140
hostile takeovers, the typical variations of the steel industry,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.640
and by leaders who don't know what they want,
who don't know if they want to nationalize or not...

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.800
—anyway, all these problems!

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080
But I did not go there to feel nostalgic,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.640
even though I was delighted to recite part of the song "Les Mains D'or" (Hands Of Gold).

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.360
"At night they look like warships, beaten by the waves, tormented by the sea, "

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.720
"fallen on their side, slapped by the tide, defeated by money, monsters of steel"

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.260
"I would like to work again, work again, and forge this red steel with my hands of gold"

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.780
"work again, work again, red steel, hands of gold"

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.280
And, well, these verses move me,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.280
what I did not realize though was the emotion felt by my two friends whom you see on the video

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.720
as I talked—they both are steel workers—

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.780
And there was the CGT union representative Lionel Burriello

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.600
—he is the branch representative for Florange, the site—

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.680
and, well, they were very very touched.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.780
We chatted about it afterwards together, and he told me "you nearly had me crying",

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.160
but it would have been uncomfortable had we made him cry during the meeting.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.780
Anyway!

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.620
So, I think anyone can understand the interest in having a quality metallurgy industry

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.380
Usually, people aren't interested in metallurgy

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.580
or, maybe they understand about the thin steel sheets used to make cans.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.840
Everyone has had a canned drink at least once in their life.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.600
Those are typical products from the steel industry.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.600
And, granted, it is not the most complex aspect.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.600
What is complex is to produce a very pure steel in order to make products of high industrial interest out of it.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.020
For instance, you must have heard that we have a problem with nuclear power plants,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.420
which concerns the quality of the steel —but it doesn't come from Florange!

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.140
The steel that is used in these plants is not as pure as it should be.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.500
There is just too much carbon in it, and since those parts are placed within a reactor

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.840
they are subject to thermal shocks—sometimes it's very hot, and sometimes a lot less.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.600
When there happens to be residual carbon in unacceptably high quantities in the steel's structure, it makes it brittle.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.780
I believe that knowing this, everyone understands that for a millionth of extra grams of carbon,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.780
machinery can break down, with potentially catastrophic consequences in the case of a nuclear power plant.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.900
See, those are the stakes of having high quality production and techniques.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.000
You have to think about it, otherwise you can't understand why it is so important to us all,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.060
and why it is we are so keen on making sure we have quality production sites and good quality products

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.420
—and we're going to need them more and more!

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.240
Whether you agree or disagree, we will always need to make steel

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.800
to build wind turbines, water turbines, and all these machines we need

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.980
in order to transition to a 100 % sustainable energies, and to get rid of nuclear power plants

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.580
and all these reactors and facilities where steel is of poor quality.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.620
This new steel needs to be of top quality.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.480
This is a discussion we had with the two unions that accepted to see me before we started the meeting,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.120
the CGT and the CFDT.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.140
We didn't have a typical discussion about wages, employment and all that,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.500
but we talked about skills.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:20.940
My question was whether we were capable of producing this kind of steel that we'll need or not,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.060
and they had their own questions.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:32.560
These two unions were very concerned with the issue of the ecological production of steel.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.340
Most people aren't familiar with this issue,
but the workers of this industry are,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.180
and they feel concerned about it.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.540
When you make a ton of cast iron,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.640
in order to make these sorts of parallelepipeds called slabs,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.020
well when you make a ton of cast iron, you release two tons of CO2 in the atmosphere—this is quite significant!

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:05.820
So, reducing the quantity of CO2 that is released in the atmosphere when we make steel is essential.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.860
And now, there are techniques that enable us to capture the gas that comes out of blast furnaces

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.360
in order to reinject it in the blast furnaces—I'm talking about oxygen, CO2 etc.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.960
And of course, this process enables workers to burn iron twice, and to burn it better,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.460
which makes a purer steel and releases less CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.320
This issue is important to us.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.280
If we take these issues seriously, we have to take care of these technical aspects,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:41.180
we can't just say "it's simple, let's do this and that",
and not wonder whether it's possible and how it should be done.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:46.620
Clearly, if we don't involve the majority of the workers of this industry, this won't work.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.660
We just saw that the steel industry is very important for dealing with nuclear power.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.320
And I'd like to tell you that there are more and more arguments against nuclear power.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:04.340
And let me remind the simpletons who say that phasing out nuclear power would compel us to go back to candle lighting,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.780
that on the contrary, it's rather if we keep using nuclear power that we'll go back to candle lighting,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.000
because it doesn't work, and this thing is not fluid.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.720
Why? Because there always has to be a precise balance in the electricity system of a country.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.600
We always have to produce the precise quantity of electricity that is needed at any given moment.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.980
An unbalance would cause the collapse of the network.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.440
Nuclear power plants aren't the easiest tool for adjusting the production.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.920
And when there's a cold snap, you suddenly need to produce a lot of electircity,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.820
and since some nuclear power plants are at a standstill right now, well it creates an unbalance.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.240
In this case, we usually import electricity from neighboring countries, but there's a cold snap there too,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.560
so they also use electricity.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.200
All this is a bit complicated, but it leads you back to what I said when I was visiting dams a few weeks ago.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.780
Some people wondered why I was visiting these dams, well that's why!

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.140
I know that we need these dams to maintain the stability of the electricity network.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.360
Dams are the easiest equipments to stop or reactivate,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.520
but it doesn't mean that they can work endlessly,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.660
because they have to be full of water,
and therefore, it has to rain.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.340
So dams have to be filled in the spring.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.480
I might be a bit annoying with all these technical issues, but technical aspects must become a political issue.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:27.840
We can't just say: "How much does it cost? Bla bla", which is the sole concern of smart cookies,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.240
although this is absolute nonsense, because most of the time, they wonder what is the cost of this or that,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.140
but they never wonder what is the cost of misery and diseases,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.440
or absurd decisions like not doing anything about nuclear power, although we all know there's a problem.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.260
I won't go into details, otherwise this Review will be about electricity only, and everyone will get bored.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.040
I just want to add that this shows why we need to transition to 100 % renewable energies,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.920
and why we need stable and highly flexible energy resources.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:05.400
Even if we use 100 % renewable energies, we need to use different energy resources,

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:11.800
because relying on wind energies only would be as stupid as relying on nuclear power only.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:23.940
So we need mixed energy resources and productions that consist in making each area energetically autonomous.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.820
I was in Martinique and Guadeloupe a few weeks ago, and we discussed this issue.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.100
I visited a power station in Guadeloupe too, you know,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.080
the Bouillante power plant whose production comes from the heat of a volcano.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.320
And of course, we did the same with this plant as with other power stations: we sold it!

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.360
In the course of the last five years, under the authority of François Hollande, France became famous for

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.780
selling nearly all the companies that produced engines capable of producing alternative energy resources.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.380
So thank you François Hollande!

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.680
Remember him the day there is a problem,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:01.240
because if we ever have a problem, it will be because of his carelessness and incapacity to decide.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.480
Now we have to take care of this problem,
and I am determined to do it.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.700
There was bad news this morning,
and I guess everyone heard about it.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.980
We've been told that monkeys might disappear within the next 25 to 50 years.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.380
Monkeys are our cousins!

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.480
It's horrible to think about this kind of things.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.520
I recently told you that half of vertebrates were disappearing, do you remember?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.240
I must say I'm rather pessimistic about this,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.920
because I read a book by Elisabeth Kolbert on this issue for Christmas, a book entitled "The 6th extinction".

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:39.420
It deals with this species extinction process caused by climate change and other parameters.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.280
What other parameters? Well human activity!

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.300
Human activity! It's because of human activity!

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.340
So we can do something about it, because our own activity is responsible for this! We can do something about it!

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:55.240
And last December, the International Geological Society—I think it's the correct name—

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:03.440
decided to name the period we are living in the "anthropocene", after a quite long discussion,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:09.600
The "anthropocene" refers to the period in which men—human beings more precisly—

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.920
disrupt the life of the planet in such a way that they change its geology.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.960
So this association did not develop fancy abstract ideas, but very concrete ones.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.980
You can detect a new period within the ground layers—the folds of the ground.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.660
You know, there are landforms that show that the Earth...

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.120
There are landforms—I don't remember their name—in which we see the different ground layers.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.640
All the historical layers are visible, and our layer will be visible too. It won't be a big layer though!

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:43.480
In 10,000 years, the layer of the period we are living in will be as thick as rolling paper.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.560
And within this thin layer, there will be strange substances that won't be found before or after
— hopefully not after!

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.020
—in any case not before, and among these substances, there will be substances from the nuclear industry,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.880
plus the substances that come from military tests that are already there,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.200
and also substances like plastic that are not natural, that are human creations.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.900
Human beings, who are monkeys—because in the beginning, human beings were a monkey variety—

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:16.060
carry more rubble than all the rivers, all the winds and all the avalanches in the world.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.740
Consequently, human beings transform nature.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:25.860
But they do it in a way that destroys the environment in which we all live,

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.760
and in the end, we will all suffer the consequences.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.300
So if we analyze this monkey issue—and if we don't want to be tragic and alarmist—

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.140
and if we analyze the reasons that caused this situation, well we find the usual parameters!

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.920
We destroy forests!

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.840
—in order to take wood, but above all to create meadows in order to rear cattle,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:53.700
because our civilization is organized around the consumption of meat proteines.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.200
You're supposed to need them, OK?!

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.240
I tried to alert the public opinion on this issue...

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:06.280
—I mean I did my bit, because those who did the job were associations, but I did my bit.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.080
I talked about quinoa in order to say that we could consume plant proteins rather than meat proteins,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:21.040
and all of a sudden, all the scoffers on the planet started mocking me, saying: "What's happening to Mélenchon with his quinoa recipe?"

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:28.340
I even saw mean people who said: "We won't change things by eating quinoa!"—Well yes, you dimwit!

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.520
I'm absolutely certain that we will change things by consuming plant proteins.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.160
A lot of people understand the situation.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.380
They know we have to consume plant proteins rather than meat proteins.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.540
You see, what I say is coherent.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.080
Intensive farming is absurd...

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.960
because it doesn't take into account the impact it has on nature.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:04.420
I mean, meadows are useful to regulate CO2 quantities in the atmosphere,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:12.000
but producing meat is extremely damaging to environment, and we can use alternatives,
so it's really stupid.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:18.100
Humanity has not always eaten meat as we are doing now, that's not true!

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.280
And meat is not produced for you, that's also not true!

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:27.380
It comes from the carcasses of animals that were reared to produce milk,

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.780
so you eat a by-product from the dairy industry!

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:37.740
And as you know, milk is produced as a commodity, and in the end, it results in things like the 1000-cow farms,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:44.280
where these poor animals never breathe the outdoor air nor see any pasture.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:51.500
They're stacked in these farms and produce methane gas when they burp and fart that is captured and sold,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.360
they're crammed with antibiotics and other substances, because seclusion easily causes diseases,

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:04.760
and then you drink this milk and you eat this meat that comes from this way of organizing farming,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.220
and this has to stop!

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.780
Now let me tell you something.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:19.180
I am glad to learn that some retail chains decided to stop chicken battery farming and other abuses to produce eggs.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.920
I know some people grumble about it, but I don't!

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.320
And if I have the opportunity to do so, I will forbid other types of battery farming.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:32.320
Right now, we're interested in the life conditions of chickens, but if you knew how rabbits are reared, you just couldn't sleep anymore!

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.440
And it would be the same if you knew how pigs are reared.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.360
You might wonder why a politician suddenly deals with pigs, chickens etc.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.620
Well, because that's life!
What is life if it's not living things?

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.960
Financial records? Money?
Is that it?

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.760
What should we do?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.900
Should we admire the beauty of the world around us?

00:17:52.740 --> 00:18:00.060
Or should we admire the feats of the eight gangsters who manage to accumulate as much money as the rest of humanity?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.460
This is what we should learn!
The world is full of philosophy lessons today!

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.900
People who care about life should deal with these issues!

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.040
This presidential election is the opportunity to wonder if we could not change all this once and for all,

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.680
and I'm prepared to do this!

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.660
Now I'll tell you about something that might seem secondary.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:26.100
You may have heard that Mrs. Chelsea Manning was just pardoned by President Obama.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.760
This woman is one of the whistleblowers who provided Wikileaks with information...

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.300
...Assange being the most famous person in this story.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.080
You probably know Mr. Assange.
He was involved in the Wikileaks network.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:50.540
He is now locked—or rather, he locked himself in a room of the embassy of Ecuador in London.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:19:00.260
He can't leave the room, because he would be arrested if he did, and he fears extradition to the USA.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.980
American authorities are waiting for him in order to have him go through the same crual and inhuman treatment

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.080
as Mrs. Chelsea Manning, to which Mr. Obama just put an end.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:16.260
She was denounced by a hacker to whom she gave information about the intelligence she was leaking,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.480
and she was held incommunicado—that's the way it happens there—

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.320
she was treated in horrible conditions, held incommunicado for months,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.960
and then judged by a military tribunal.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:34.660
In this fantastic American democracy, there are tribunals that we call special courts in France,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:40.540
—we abolished them in 1981, but not them!

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.980
And this so-called military judge sentenced 
Chelsea Manning to 35 years imprisonment.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:53.060
This woman was treated in such a degrading and inhuman way that she tried to commit suicide.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.560
And that's just one of the examples that were given by associations that defend human rights.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:09.320
Because you know, talking about the abuses that are inflicted to people by the USA is not politically correct.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.640
North-Americans set a center in Guantanamo, on the island of Cuba,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.120
and they've been torturing prisoners there for around 11 years.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:25.640
The torture methods that are used there have been voted and approved by the North-American state.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:35.800
Mrs. Chelsea Manning was so distressed, humiliated and broken that she tried to commit suicide.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.520
Do you know what North-Americans decided to do after she tried to commit suicide?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.660
They decided to punish her by holding her incommunicado, so she tried to commit suicide again!

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.440
This is the reality of the United States of America!

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.560
And then people think it's great that Mr. Obama pardoned her! What a joke! After all she's been through!

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.560
All things considered, this Obama was not such a great president,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.660
because he was not that courageous, he chickened out during his whole term of office,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.320
and he just let things run their course, so much so that it ended up as it always ends up:

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.820
when you elect an Hollande or a Clinton—the nationality doesn't matter—you end up with a Trump!

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.480
And, Chelsea Manning and Assange's contribution was extraordinary,

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:23.160
because they really broke down the opaque wall that the USA built around their activities.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.920
Thanks to them, we learned that the USA spied on about every country.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:34.120
We learned that some French political leaders, among which a lot of members of the Socialist Party,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:42.420
rushed to the American embassy in Paris when the French government refused to take part in the Iraq War

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.720
—I mean the second war of 2003.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:50.840
We'll never be grateful enough to Chirac and De Villepin for sparing us from getting into this quagmire,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.520
and from feeling ashamed of being responsible of the current situation there.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.900
Manning and Assange showed what really happened.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.460
We saw things that we would have never seen otherwise,

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:12.640
like the way a plane destroyed a group of Iraqi civilians that were in no way a threat, for instance,

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:18.560
or the various bombings of civilians
and—let's be frank—the war crimes of the USA

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.320
that were as murderous as the war crimes in Aleppo, which shows that clean wars are a fantasy.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.260
I'm not saying this to lessen the horror of any war whatsoever,

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.960
it's just that I don't choose between differents horrors,
I don't consider some horrors acceptable and others unacceptable.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:41.700
As I'm speaking, bombings continue in Yemen and Mossul,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.820
and you'll notice that protests suddenly ceased,
and that's not fair,

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.520
because these poor devils suffer in the middle of this battle.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:58.960
Once again, civilians are trapped in the middle of a war, and nobody does anything to stop this war,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.580
and yet, the only thing that is worth doing is to stop this war.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:07.700
Speaking of war, I'd like to tell you about an excellent initiative that was taken by China,

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.700
—I'll be criticized for saying this, I know—

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:19.140
but the Chinese government and President Xi Jinping proposed a ban on all the nuclear weapons.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:28.460
At last, a great power—the leading world power—defends the idea that we must put an end to nuclear weapons again.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.640
This initiative by the Chinese President is excellent,
and we the French should support it.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.900
We should support every initiative that emanates from the UNO, such a wonderful idea in particular,

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.780
because no one dealt with this issue anymore.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:50.520
Not so long ago, this was a major issue during the period of the balance of power between the East and the West,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.220
or as we used to say, the Socialist Bloc and the United States.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:00.540
Now France's position must be the following—it is the position we've always had—

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.260
we agree with the ban on nuclear weapons...

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.740
First, we disagree with nuclear proliferation, which means that we refuse that other countries develop nuclear weapons.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.400
Some say: "It's easy to say that, because you the French have nucler weapons".

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.340
Yes we do! But does the fact that other countries have it help solving the problem?

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.460
Does it help solving the problem? No it doesn't!
So we disagree with nuclear proliferation!

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.840
More particularly, we refuse that certain countries have nuclear weapons that threaten neighboring countries.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.920
For instance, the fact that Israel has the bomb is unacceptable, even though they got it by spying on France.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.440
We disagree with India having the bomb, because we know that India does so against Pakistan,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.660
that also armed itself with nuclear weapons.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.700
And, this changes everything!

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:50.260
When you're a country like France or...
any geographically small country,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:57.360
nuclear weapons are used to deter enemies, which means that we do not accept any war against us,

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.860
or any attempt to intimidate us through force.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.240
Any country that would bomb us would instantaneously bombed.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.500
But let's tell it like it is, nuclear weapons are horrible!

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.340
Horrible!

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.260
Nuclear weapons are posthumous weapons, which means that if you are bombed, you retaliate by striking the enemy

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.680
in one, two or three places that cause maximum damage, but it's over for you, you're dead!

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:26.480
So first, nuclear weapons are posthumous weapons: you're already dead when they strike the enemy,

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.160
and second, you're not supposed to ever use them, because essentially, they are deterring weapons,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.140
but they're dangerous!

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.440
And when you're in a country with a population of a billion people,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.740
a weapon that was strategic
—let's call it an all-or-nothing weapon—

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:47.420
becomes a tactic weapon, which means that countries of that size can take one, two or three strikes before they cease the combat.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.380
So it is very important to us to prevent nuclear proliferation,

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:59.520
and as far as I'm concerned, I have always been in favor of preventing Iran, India or Pakistan to have the bomb,

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.720
although I am well aware of the argument that says that we have the bomb.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.720
Now what should we do with our own nuclear force?

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.580
Of course, we agree with the fact that all nuclear forces disappear,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.160
but we the French have the right to think about our own defense!

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.540
We agree with getting rid of our nuclear weapons on the condition that other countries do the same!

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.180
And the countries that must start getting rid of their nuclear weapons are the biggest nuclear powers,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.800
that is, Russia on the one hand,
and the USA on the other hand,

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.160
because their nuclear arsenal are powerful enough to destroy  7 or 8 times the planet,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:37.380
which shows the absurdity of this apparatus, because once it's been struck, it can't be struck again.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.000
Everyone can undertand that.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.580
So you see, this is a very delicate issue to deal with.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.100
It has to be dealt with great aplomb and a lot of determination.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.580
And I'm glad that a great power like China—that has nuclear weapons too,

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.460
which explains why its neighbors want to have the bomb!—

00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:02.240
...I'm glad that a power like China begin to assume the responsibility of its position in the world,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.860
because obviously, the leading world power has responsibilities towards the rest of the world.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.380
I must say that...

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.820
Of course, with all the criticism that can be addressed to the Chinese government...

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:20.060
—in Europe or in the USA, when you talk about certain countries, you have to criticize them to begin with!

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.500
And especially now that Mr. Trump decided he wanted to harass China,

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.140
you'll see that we're going to have an anti-Chinese atmosphere in France as never before

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:37.280
in all the newspapers and the circles that are under the influence—as they say—of the USA and of North-American security agencies.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.160
I'll avoid mentionning specific newspapers or everyone will fall out with me again,

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.940
but you got the point: Xi Jinping did us a service.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.800
Now it's time to say goodbye because...

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.440
You don't see it because Antoine is editing,

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.740
but there's a constant flow of passengers as I'm speaking—of course there is, I'm in a corridor!

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.440
Here we go again!

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.680
-Passengers: Hello, excuse us!
-JLM: Hello Madam!

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.080
-Passenger: Thank you very much!
-JLM: I'm sorry Mister!

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.640
It's all right!

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.960
Just a second, someone's passing.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.980
JLM: Sorry! Thank you Mister!
Passenger: Good luck!

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.600
JLM: No, thank you!
Passenger: Good luck for the campaign!
JLM: Thank you!

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.120
JLM: Ha! It's ticket-checking time!
Conductor: It won't be long!

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.060
JLM: Hello!

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:28.060
OK, so, I think it's time to stop this video.
I'm losing my train of thought...

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.200
...because of the flow of passengers—but it's normal, this isn't a studio!

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.100
The sound is probably not good...

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.240
...and in addition to the noise of the train,
you probably hear this damn air conditioning!

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.960
I don't know why, but there's the air conditioning everywhere,

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.460
and the result is that we who often take the train, we 're always ill—we have this sort of never-ending sinusitis!

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.620
So goodbye, and if you want to give a hand to this show,

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.020
there's a very simple way to do it: give us the little blue thumbs up,

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.720
it contributes to the ranking of this video,

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.040
and it makes all sorts of people jealous,
who feel compelled to do weekly reviews too,

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.900
but they make a laughingstock of themselves,
and this is a delight!

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.000
And now is the time for me to drink a cup of coffee, the best part of taking the train,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.260
but you noticed that we improvised a mug like those we sell in our "L'insoumis(e)" gift boxes.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:23.640
See?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.880
Goodbye and see you soon!
