00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Hi! Welcome back!

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.000
The last Weekly Review was quite efficient, because I encouraged everyone to register to vote,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.460
and I'm glad that it worked.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.540
The last time I encouraged people to register to vote, it was 3 days before the deadline,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.560
and 49,000 people went to register at the last minute.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.960
So... I wrote a letter in order to ask for the registration deadline to be postponed,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.960
because if so many people went to register at the last minute, then more people could probably do the same.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.200
And... I didn't receive any answer. None!

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.700
It's a pity, because it could be done with a simple decree. It just takes a few minutes,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.900
and it would enable thousands of more people to vote.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.420
But I'm not really surprised, because the attitude of the government is curious as far as elections are concerned.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.020
They didn't seem very interested in enabling people to vote.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.800
Besides, the elections of union representatives in very small businesses are taking place right now.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.000
You may not be aware of it if you did not watch the last Review,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.760
but this Mrs. El Khomry - who forced her labor law into the legislature -

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.920
well she organized these elections in the middle of the festive season!

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.980
She did everything she could to make these elections fail!

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:36.340
I hope everyone will vote, because it is almost the only collective right that an employee can assert in a very small business.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.540
OK.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.820
I'm talking about this because I'll be in Tourcoing next Sunday.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.360
We are going to "turn up" in the city, that's the expression we used.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.320
It may seem strange, but "turning up" is not the same as marching, it means arriving somewhere, as they say.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.400
We are doing this because a recent event occurred in Tourcoing that shocked a lot of my acquaintances,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.620
so I decided to talk about it.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.740
A cashier had a miscarriage at her workplace.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.800
So...

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.100
A miscarriage is a very traumatic experience  both physically and psychologically,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.840
so I understand why it moved a lot of people.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.720
Besides she's young, so a lot of people identify with her, and think it is not normal to be ill-treated like that.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.680
The demands and distress of employees are never taken into account.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.720
Do you remember Emeline, the mailwoman? Well it was the same.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.020
She was at work and she said: "I'm not feeling well, I need to go home".

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.280
"No, no, you stay there, back to work!" and bam! she had a stroke.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:58.160
I think these incidents should alarm staff managers.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.380
They should wonder if they do what they have to do to make employees happy at their workplace

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.080
and to avoid putting them in danger.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.860
But today's management consists in intimidating employees.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.340
"You'll go back home when I'll say you can!"

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.440
"You'll go to the toilets when I'll say you can!"...

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.680
etc.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.560
People are afraid of complaining, because their job is their only income. They just don't have a choice!

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:34.520
They are forced to put up with it, but at some point, someone has to collapse either physically or mentally.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.480
This is the reason why we'll be in Tourcoing next Sunday.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.960
I'll speak about working conditions at the municipal theater.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:53.100
I think it is important that a candidate who runs for president speak about issues that concern a lot of people's life in this country.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.040
People go through silent sufferings because no one ever talks about employees' working conditions.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.100
People at the top of the country's media superstructure don't really care.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:11.580
But we have to admit that this Auchan affair in Tourcoing had a strong mediatic impact, because there's been a lot of articles about it,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.280
articles about the working conditions of supermarket cashiers in particular,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.100
who get all sorts of occupational diseases because of the weight of the articles they lift.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:32.720
You'd think it's not much - just a few packets of chewing gums and a packet of crisps - but they do it all day long,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:42.700
and when clients rush at the checkout, they have to lift and carry a lot of articles, and it  can be painful.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.140
So this issue has to be taken seriously. Think about it when you go shopping!

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:56.400
When you see the cashier - who's more often a woman than a man - think about all he or she has to do,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.520
and it doesn't cost much to say 'thank you', 'hello' and 'goodbye', I think they'll appreciate, believe me!

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.320
OK, so... this incident occurred in an Auchan supermarket.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:21.640
Auchan is a company that belongs to the AFM. Do you know what the AFM is?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.160
It is the Mulliez Family Association.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.240
It is a sort of shareholding and family communism.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:41.360
It's not for me to say bad things about such and such person, but I think that this family is going a bit too far.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.100
Because...

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.040
They don't pay taxes in France to begin with.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.120
And I don't like that.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.100
They do business in France, their employees were educated in France and get medical care in France,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.180
so they should pay taxes in France.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.940
They should do as every French does.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.040
I was told that I could do nothing about this because their tax household was declared in Belgium.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.160
I know this, they live right on the border with France.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.060
Someone wrote down to me how much they pay, and they don't pay much, really not.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.380
But...

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.780
Let's tell it like it is.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.500
The police led searches in some of their properties last May

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:38.400
because apparently, tax authorities do not agree with the tax returns of the different entities of the AFM.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.600
So this family is facing this problem, but there's a new problem on the horizon: me.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.840
If I become President, you may go wherever you want,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.980
be it the very depths of Patagonia or a recess of Mongolia, but I'll be there!

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.540
Why? Because we will change the income tax legislation.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.560
We will implement the taxation of expatriates.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:16.060
This means that wherever you live in the world, you pay taxes in the country you live in,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.840
but you also send your income tax return to French tax authorities.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.360
Tax authorities then compare what you paid abroad and what you should have paid if you lived in France,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.400
and you have to pay the difference to French tax authorities.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.260
So what's the reason for this proposition? And where does this idea come from?

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.180
Americans do this, so you can't say it is an insane left-wing idea!

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.440
Let me tell you that North-Americans take this very seriously.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:55.520
They call banks in every country to make investigations if they have the least suspicion of "americanity" about one of their clients.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.900
How do I know this? Well it's because the people I know are those who work, and not those who give orders.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.820
So I was informed about this by people working in the banking sector.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.360
The USA don't want to lose a penny, and they're right!

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.620
Well I'll do exactly the same!

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:16.580
I know this system which consists in reporting one's income and paying taxes in one place

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.740
and then sending one's income tax return to your country's tax authorities, that work out if you owe them money.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:27.360
Do you know why I know this? Well it's simple, I'm a Euro MP, so this system applies to me, and it's a good thing!

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:35.440
I report my income to the European Union that taxes part of it,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:43.340
and then I send my income tax return to French tax authorities that work out how much I owe them

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:49.260
based on what I would pay if I was a normal taxpayer in France, and it's a good thing!

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
That's not all!

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.760
Those who would not like to pay their taxes in France...

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.540
- I don't know what sorts of scheme they'll come up with in the future because it will become difficult -

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:07.140
well I want to warn them: I don't agree with the fact that French citizens do business in France if they pay their taxes abroad.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.140
I'll put an end to this!

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.540
But let us calm down.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:19.100
We will implement the taxation of expatriates, and the members of the Mulliez family will therefore be able to cross the border again

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.000
in order to live in their country, except if they want to keep living in Belgium because they love their house,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.180
or because they love the landscape, or because they live far from a road.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:37.580
I'm saying this because I read that living close to a road increased the risks of insanity.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.640
That's the way it is. It is due to toxic particles in the air.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.500
This was a half joke to bring this matter to a close.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:57.940
What I mean is that we have been putting up with all the whims of billionaires and shareholders of the Paris Stock Exchange for 15 years,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.400
- 15 years! -

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.400
and now we see the result: there are more millionaires today, and rich people got even richer!

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.740
But there are also more poor people. They are 9 million in this country!

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.280
And in Germany - that is supposed to be our economic ideal - they are 13 million!

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:26.020
In addition to poverty... which comes from an absolutely barbaric way of producing and exchanging,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.140
since only a few people accumulate while the rest have nothing! That's barbarism!

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.420
But above all, it makes people suffer at work at every level of society, everywhere!

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:42.000
We have to make a lot of money quickly with the smallest possible number of employees, so...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.600
I intend to talk about the concerns of employees in this presidential campaign.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.800
I hear a lot of candidates who say: "I am the candidate of labor! I'll speak to you about labor!" Well get to work!

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:03.040
Of course we will talk about labor, about the content of labor, that is, skills and qualifications,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.620
but we must also think about employees as human beings, which means that we have to talk about human beings.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:15.320
We can't just talk about broad issues, that are all the more easy to deal with that they are broad.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:25.140
As a conclusion, I found out about what this family was doing... They own Auchan and many other companies.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.860
It's a large group! It's the 13th largest distribution group in the world!

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.180
There are many French distribution companies in the world.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:38.940
The Mulliez group does a lot of business in France. I think they own around 126 supermarkets in the country.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.900
They also do a lot of business in Russia!

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:48.220
You see, there's a difference between what they say in their newspapers and what they actually do.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.460
I said 'their newspapers' because I thought about something as I was reading my notes:

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:59.120
this family owns a school of journalism. Can you believe it?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.120
Well yes, they own a school of journalism!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:10.020
It is possible to own one! They own a school of journalism as you could own a horse, a house or a bike.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.900
Besides, it's not just any school of journalism, it's the most important school of the country!

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:22.120
Incidentally, these schools of journalism may have qualities, but they produce the same kind of journalists,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.860
that is, journalists who always ask the same questions,

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:35.440
and whatever your answers, they stick to the questions they had planned to ask.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.060
Now this won't last long.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:44.420
If I become President, I'll definitely reform these schools of journalism.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.700
First, journalists should not always be those who attended these schools.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:57.860
You might be surprised to hear me say that, but in my day, people with different occupations could become journalists.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.360
They brought something different to editorial commitees humanly speaking.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:09.180
They were not the same fish sticks with identical sizes and packagings that we know today.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.400
As to the degrees awarded by these schools,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.660
they should at least be as serious as the rest of our country's professional degrees.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.420
When you're a plumber or a zinc worker for instance,

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.380
you choose a boilermaker training program to get a certificate or a diploma

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:31.580
- it's not the easiest training program by the way, because you sometimes have to make objects within a micron! -

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:38.220
and there's a syllabus that says such job requires such and such skills.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.140
And it's not someone sitting in his office who decides the requirements on his own,

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.520
but it's a commission made up of representatives from the Ministry of Education,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.820
of labor unions and of employer representatives - in short, people who know their business!

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.800
That's the way it happens, except for journalists!

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:59.040
They attend schools and get degrees, but what is the guarantee that these degrees are worth something?

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.860
Well it's simply the reputation of these schools!

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:09.320
So the schools that manage to make some good publicity and to fit as many students as possible in newspapers are considered good schools.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.500
Do you understand where their reputation comes from now? Good!

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.040
Well this situation is not serious, because this occupation is fundamental to the functioning of democracy.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:22.860
Now the news was marked by the consequences of the situation in Syria this week.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.820
You know that this is a tricky issue for me,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:33.440
because whatever I say on the matter, it is always distorted in the media...

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.380
to make gutter journalism...

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.800
That's the way it is...

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:47.940
For instance the other day, I was interviewed by France Inter radio, and I was asked questions about Trump.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:56.640
At some point, I said I'd like to work with the guy because he intends to put an end to free-trade international agreements.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:04.140
It suits me fine because I have been opposing the free trade agreement with the USA since 1996, so...

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.060
if the President of the USA himself wants to stop it, then I'm OK with it.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:16.080
Well they made a headline that said something like "Mélenchon would be glad to work with Donald Trump".

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.320
As you can see, journalism is serious business...

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.720
Anyway, what matters is the agreement.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.940
The agreement that was signed is a ceasefire agreement.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.660
It is an agreement between Turkey and Russia.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.360
Isn't it curious?

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.260
We were told that this war opposed "moderate rebels"...

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.120
meaning they are... moderate!

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.000
moderate...

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.100
...to Bashar Al Assad's government.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.980
They were supposed to be the belligerents, but who signed a ceasefire agreement?

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.880
Turkey and Russia!

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.920
I don't get it!

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:04.900
I thought the belligerents were "moderate rebels" and Mr. Al Assad, but it turns out that Turkey and Russia signed the ceasefire agreement!

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.600
What's going on?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.860
Were we lied to? Were we deceived?

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:18.060
So this war is not a war between moderate rebels and the government, or a religious war, as they said,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.220
but a war between countries? Well yes!

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.380
And that's what I have been saying since the beginning!

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:30.400
We could have stopped the war months ago if we had adressed the issue from a realistic standpoint.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.080
We should have had the belligerents come to the table.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.560
They are fighting this war because they are regional powers,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:45.440
and because they want to have access to the strategic raw material of our time: oil and gas.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:52.340
Instead, we were told a story that must be utterly incomprehensible to people who are trying to understand the situation.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.920
They wonder why it was Turkey and Russia that signed the agreement.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.200
Anyway, I'm happy that this agreement was signed.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.880
A ceasefire means that bombings will stop. There aren't any clean bombings! Clear bombings never existed anywhere!

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.740
Neither in Aleppo nor Mossul, or in Yemen,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:19.320
or in France, when Americans bombed the Normandy shores to dislodge the Germans,

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.360
wiping several cities off the map in the process.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.460
So you see, clean bombings never existed and will never exist.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:38.560
The UNO resolution that approves the ceasefire and that furthers the ideas implied by the ceasefire was adopted unanimously, OK?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:44.320
So if you want to know my position on the subject, well it is the position of the UNO that was adopted unanimously.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:51.120
It is possible that warmongers in some editorial boards wish to carry on this... thing...

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:59.980
because they keep writing articles that say the only problem is Russia.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.460
Anyway, my position is the unanimous decision of the UNO.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.780
The UNO says that we have to organize negotiations betweens the belligerents of the war.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.080
But that's not all!

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.820
The UNO made a list of the belligerents that should not take part in the negotiations, not bad hey?

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.060
The UNO says there has to be negotiations, but they should not include several belligerents.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:27.240
Who are these belligerents? ISIS, Al Nusra and Al Qaeda.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.380
Al Nusra and Al Qaeda were the "moderate rebels" who fought in Aleppo,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.880
but the unanimous UNO resolution says that we should not negotiate with them but make war on them.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:43.680
So I agree with this agreement that should restore peace,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:50.780
provided that the negotiations continue, and that troublemakers do not disturb this process.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.760
I think the poor Syrians have had enough, so it is time to stop this war.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.460
We can do this if we organize a serious discussion, but what then?

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.900
Well... what can we do?

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.980
What's the idea? What do you think we can do?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.940
Elections!

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.800
Do you know another way to choose a government?

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.180
So we have to organize elections!

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.180
But some people say it's not possible because there's a war!

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.380
Well that's precisely why we have to stop it!

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.600
There's a ceasefire, and it could lead to peace.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.880
Organizing election consists in sending refugees back into their country...

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:31.180
If they don't, we can make a list of Syrians abroad - we do this in France, so why would it not be possible with other countries?

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.140
And then we have to make electoral registers in Syria.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.660
International organizations know how to do this, it's not complicated!

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.940
Making electoral registers and organizing elections is more simple

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.620
than making war, bombing and transporting military equipment!

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.220
Making war is ten times more complicated than organizing elections!

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.600
So don't tell me that it is a utopia and that it is not possible!

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.600
It is possible!

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:03.460
Besides, the UNO resolution says that all the issues - the issue of the Bashar Al Assad's regime included - have to be settled by elections.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:14.180
My guess is that now that Turkey obtained what it wanted,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.780
and that Russia keeps the Tartus military base there - their only military base in the Mediterranean! -

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.780
well...

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.200
we'll be able to find a democratic solution,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.940
and of course, it's up to the Syrian people to decide if they want to maintain Bashar Al Assad in office,

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.800
and I think it is not so crazy to say that the Syrian people would probably want to move on

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.400
if we guarantee the possibility of doing it.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.440
I've been saying from the beginning.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.320
But there's an absolutely crazy atmosphere these days.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.900
Some people are acting as if this was the Cold War, but this situation has nothing to do with the Cold War!

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.900
The USSR no longer exists!

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.320
Russia is a capitalist power as other countries.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.700
I read articles about the so-called rearmament of Russia...

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.080
Did you know that Saudi Arabia's military budget was bigger than Russia's?

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.840
Can you imagine how big military budgets are?

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.120
The biggest military budget after the USA is China's budget.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.300
So you can see that this state of agitation is designed to scare people

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.940
and to make them think there is a danger that actually does not exist.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.020
Russia doesn't have any intention to invade any country in Europe.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.480
Likewise, I don't think that China intends to invade any country.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:35.220
Besides, the USA are changing their strategy, and I think that a lot of people are going to feel stupid,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.200
and I mean big time!

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.940
They've been living under the American nuclear umbrella for 50 years, and they think it will last forever.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.780
Well it won't! North-Americans changed their mind!

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.700
Until now, they were allied with China in order to thwart Russia's influence.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.880
And now, Mr. Trump is not crazy at all, he is acting rationally.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.980
That's his choice, not mine, but he now wants to form an alliance with Russia

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.480
because China is becoming a problem for the USA, since it will become the leading world power.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.260
Consequently, the Yuan is becoming a threat to the Dollar.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.980
This is the real situation!

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.760
This will soon become a soap-opera in the official media, and you'll see that when Trump takes office,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.860
he will put an end to the retaliation measures against Russia.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:28.620
Europeans will feel stupid - and they are! - because they are still imposing these measures on Russia,

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:35.300
although we Europeans paid the price for these sanctions against Russia, in agriculture in particular.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.820
And you'll see that it will be the same old story again: the Chinese will become the new devil,

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.360
and for some newspapers it already is.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.840
As for us, let's stay calm and keep our cool.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.860
We must analyze the situation and take sides, and our side is France!

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.360
We must look at the situation from a French standpoint and our interest is peace, not war!

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.180
We don't want a war in Europe, with Russia or with any country!

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.560
We want peace, not war!

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.160
Therefore, we must do everything we can to calm things down everywhere,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.580
and to do that, one of the things we have to do

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:16.180
is to denounce those who turn up the heat, be they motivated by self-interest or financial interest, or because it is their job.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.780
Can you realize, people?

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.800
What we called the Cold War is over.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.780
Many of you did not live during this period.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.420
During that time, there was a risk of a total war between the Eastern and Western Blocs.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.620
The Eastern Bloc collapsed,

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.060
but the Western military alliance still exists, its name is NATO.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.640
In any case, the great confrontation is over!

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.500
Over!

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.080
And guess what?

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.760
The global military budget increased by 30%!

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.320
The two Blocs no longer fight one another, but the global military budget increased by 30%!

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:58.460
Don't you feel that there's an atmosphere of private interests, of military-industrial complex?

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.000
Of course there is!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.320
War is above all good business for some people.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.560
And when war begins, it is nothing but a series of organized crimes!

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.180
Enough with tall tales!

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:17.700
OK friends, I got a present from Youtube that I want to show you.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:25.280
Since a lot of you gave me the blue thumbs up and subscribed, we are now 100,000 subscribers!

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.280
We're even more, we are 150,000 subscribers now!

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.260
As a result, I got a present from Youtube that I want to show you!

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.360
It is the trophy of the 100,000 subscribers.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:43.540
They had the bad taste of writing it in English, so I refuse to read it on principle, but I understand what that means.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.800
It is a reward for reaching 100,000 subscribers,

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.200
so I told my staff that since we reached 150,000 subscribers, then I should get another one when I'll reach 200,000 subscribers.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.380
Well not at all!

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.540
I need to reach 1M subscribers to get the next trophy...

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.860
I think it will be difficult to reach that step.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.060
OK, so let's move on.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:10.740
Of course, keep subscribing and keep giving me the blue thumbs up, it helps me a lot!

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:19.580
Now I want to tell you that I'll do a new FAQ video, so send your questions and I'll answer them.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.320
And I want to thank you in advance because tha last FAQ helped me a lot.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.220
It was a success because it's been viewed more than 300,000 times,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:34.540
but it helped me to clarify some points that didn't seem problematic to me, and your questions helped me realize it.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:43.160
As you know, I'm leading this battle, and we are now entering the heated period of the presidential campaign.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.960
In a few weeks, we will know who will be the candidate of the Socialist Party if they do have one.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.740
And then the campaign will begin.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.820
Huh... Well...

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:59.400
There are now 180,000 people who support my candidacy.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:06.240
I'd really like to reach 200,000 supporters by mid-January, because it is a round number,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.200
and it gives teeth to the campaign.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.540
I know that those who follow this channel...

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:19.820
Some of you just watch because they want to hear a different point of view and...

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.720
It's normal! They're not asking for more, and I perfectly understand that.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.400
But some of you share the ideal I fight for,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.880
and maybe they did not think about signing the petition to support mu candidacy on the "jlm2017.fr" website.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.480
As long as you share my ideas, it would do me a great service if you did it.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.960
I think it would give teeth to this campaign, and I want to thank you in advance.
