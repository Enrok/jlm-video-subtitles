00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Our societies have been martyred and destroyed by neoliberalism.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.500
So much so that they've crumbled away... and that in this collapse

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.020
of everything, a gigantic doubt has spread,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.580
an incredible despise against everything: judges, police officers, journalists,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.580
political leaders. The whole country seems to be brewing an enormous

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.900
ousting, which will take place.
And our duty, our role

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.720
is to give it a positive,
constructive, peaceful

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.180
and democratic outcome.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.640
And so now, you must prepare
to come for the 18th of March.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260
Watch it and listen well folks.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.500
The 18th of March is a way for us to also make the election campaign

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.540
a premise of the civic Revolution that we want.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.080
If you are many and they see you

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.820
asking for the 6th Republic and the abolition

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.040
of the presidential monarchy—you understand?!—
then it ceases to be

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.120
an abstract slogan on which people argue while it doesn't cost them anything:

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.320
everyone can say "6th Republic, why not?"

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.300
What matters is the revolutionary act that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.100
the convocation of a National Assembly will represent.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.080
It is not me and my friends who gather in an office

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.860
to come out at you with a bill as did General de Gaulle with

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.400
Michel Debré. A few of them wrote a text and then said to the people "It's either yes or no and there's no need to discuss."

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.640
That is not the way to do it.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.820
Not because we have the taste

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.860
for bickering, but because the whole point is that by taking up

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.800
this issue, the French people is reshaping itself.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.280
Come, on the 18th of March,
any way you can, to Paris,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.860
to demand the first of all the changes that the nation needs, to refound and rebuild between all its people

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:13.000
a bond that is the only one that is worth: the political bond, the bond of a New Constitution, the bond which ends the presidential monarchy

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.800
and the absurd kinglets

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.540
with which we are afflicted.
