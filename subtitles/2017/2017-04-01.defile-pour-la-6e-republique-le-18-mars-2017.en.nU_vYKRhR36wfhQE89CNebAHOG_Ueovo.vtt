00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.920
Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon: "Everyone, listen to

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.000
that clamor rising from among us.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.340
It's like the wind

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.820
rustling through the leaves.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.260
That sound has no name but it is a warning

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.640
which comes from the might of the people

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.300
when it arises

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.520
in its History!

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.320
I knew

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.980
you were going to be there!

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760
I knew that the surge that uplifts us,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.140
generation after generation,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.440
is unlimited.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.720
In our ranks

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.160
also appear the shadows

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.280
of humanity's sad humiliated face.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.560
To all those who suffer from this sickening world,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.540
where the accumulation of wealth for some,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.180
feeds upon the continual distress of others...

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.000
We are their revenge!

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.200
We are their unaffected dignity!

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.500
And the bright expectancy

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.080
of better days.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.940
Mighty leaders of the Earth, we are coming for you.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.200
We are once again

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.920
facing a historic moment for our people...

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.480
We will be steady and consistent,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.740
trustful and patient,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.520
until victory is achieved!

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.180
We are the civil revolution

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940
always reawakening.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.000
Here is our motto:

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.900
"whatever the problem is,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.680
the answer is the people!"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.660
We must be aware of our strength,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.760
it is our liberty,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.720
it is the fire who blazes in us and will never burn out.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.300
If so many people are gathered here today

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.700
it's because they know how much the situation is critical for their country.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.300
Our project is one that promotes

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.440
a society

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.980
that is caring and considerate of its members.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.700
A peaceful

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.220
and democratic society.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.500
A society that does not tolerate starvation and poverty

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.680
in the midst of opulence!

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.800
By (re)writing the Constitution,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.620
the people itself is renewed

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.000
and reunites altogether

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.780
to become the one and indivisible Republic once again!"

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:24.400
Crowd cheering: "Resistance! Resistance! Resistance!"
