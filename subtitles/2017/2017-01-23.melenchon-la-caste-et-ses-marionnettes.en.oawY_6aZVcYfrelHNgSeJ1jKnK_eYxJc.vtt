00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
And now the real leading world power is holding a meeting in Davos.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:15.620
This year, eight people alone own as much as half of humanity.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.060
Eight people!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.000
This figure seems unbelievable.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.340
I looked at it twice, and I thought: "It cannot be eight!",

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.500
because that was not written on my sheets, obviously, but life goes faster than my sheets.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.700
This concentration of wealth goes so fast, so fast, look...

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.320
Let's go back to the previous presidential election:
in 2012, they were 159 people to own as much as 
half of humanity.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:48.280
In 2013: 92. In 2014: 80. In 2015: 62.
In 2016, they are only 8!

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.300
You see how quick this process is?
But what do you think is happening?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.200
So it obviously means that some people appropriate everything, and in order to do that, they need to deregulate everything!

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.580
They need to get rid of all the little partitions formed by social and ecological rights everywhere

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.100
in order to accumulate. They need to establish a balance of power!

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.980
They need the caste—i.e. the mediacrats plus politicians who are their puppets—to repeat from place to place:

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.700
"There's no other way!" "There's no other way!" "Mr. Mélenchon, there's no other way than competitivity and flexibility!"

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.080
And sometimes, a string gets broken. "There's no other way!"

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.520
Miserable puppets! This world is rushing towards disaster on such a basis!

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.580
(Applause)
