00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.860
This agreement is bad for France and for Europe.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.900
It will worsen the ecological and social crisis of the human civilization

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.080
because it doesn't even mention the Paris climate treaty (COP21) once,

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.479
because it encourages the import of the most polluting fossil fuels in the world,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.000
because it encourages the most brutal, cruel and disloyal form of agriculture,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.340
because it establishes special courts

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
that enable big companies to go against countries' laws.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.400
In the mean time, it accepts the social dumping of a country that didn't sign the convention

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.940
of the International Labor Organization on negotiations.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.640
This treaty would have never been adopted, or even negotiated, if my country had refused to.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.020
The French government has a particular responsibility in this matter.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.360
Likewise, this agreement would not have been accepted

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.280
if the social democrat group of the European Parliament had not supported it.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.240
This treaty in general is going to be a blow against Europe and against my homeland.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.040
I want to believe that the future generations will remember this,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.540
at least during the 2017 French presidential election.
