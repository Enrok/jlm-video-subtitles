00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.060
What will you do for the hospitals Mr. Mélenchon?

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.600
Well, you can already guess since you go the booklet

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.400
First, I want to tell you that I think the current situation is worst than what people think it is

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:16.539
things are not collapsing because there are devoted people

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.520
but  if we go on this way, they will. So we need, at least..

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.260
I've seen what all the unions say,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.040
we need at least 50 000 to 60 000 more people working in hospitals. Otherwise, things will collapse.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.500
In other words, people are physically strained.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.960
The second thing is that we have to build an environment so that

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.580
hospitals have less pressure. Creating  professionnal healthcare centers

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.120
to avoid places of medical desert because otherwise all the patients are going to a same place, in public hospital

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.520
they do not go to clinics.That would give a breather. After this, we should stop things such as T2A (Price per Activity)

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.480
and all these crazy things. It is idiocy to manage hospitals like companies.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.540
The administration is destroying the healthcare, sir.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.880
Yes, people told me that they have to fill endless paperworks.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.020
Our nurses, they leave work at 10.30pm instead of 9.00pm, we have more and more patients.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.860
And you cannot manage everything, someone told me this very well, I know it.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.440
That is frightening.
So we count on you.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.250
Protect the workers. Protect the hospitals Mr. Mélenchon!

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.680
Yes, I am doing it.
Hello lady. How are you?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.100
Ah, when you will be president, France will be better.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.220
Yes, it is clear ... Honestly, let me tell you, if we do not change the situation ...

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.220
Come see us in hospitals sir.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.140
But we are not allowed anymore, my friend,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.920
they'd say "Oh no, you have not the right, this is politics, get out".

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.420
But do you think what they do in there is not politics maybe? Eh? Tsss, of course it is!

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:57.320
Mélenchon President
