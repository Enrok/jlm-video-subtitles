00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.660
As for myself I'm often asked how I will pay for this or that.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.020
When are we going to ask them how much is the cost of dying people because of pollution?

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.940
Because of climate catastrophes?
Because of poor treatments?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.700
But you don't talk about numbers, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. We're already indebted in the order of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.000
two thousand and a hundred thousand  billion euros.
Are we dropping the debt?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.120
France is two thousand billion in debt,
96% of the GNP.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.820
How do you mathematically solve the problem of the State making absolutely no money?

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.540
So, Nicolas, let's be frank, you're saying it costs too much...
Jean-Luc Mélenchon cannot back his project.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.840
We understood from your project there was going to be a more important involvement of the State, a bigger public spending.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.980
And then, they're making somersaults.
What an horror!

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.460
How much will it cost, Mr. Mélenchon?
How will you pay for it?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:56.640
How will you, in a country with such a high debt, more than 2000 billion euros, and a rate of compulsory levy that is amongst the highest in the world?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.100
Does no-one have a programme?
No, no-one has a coherent and calculated programme.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.620
We still don't know with accuracy, as voters,
what will each of the candidates do.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.540
They still have not told us how they expect to pay for it...

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.840
By making us believe that retirement at 60 years old is possible, Jean-Luc Mélenchon is lying to us.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.760
So, not believable?
Meh, no believable, Mélenchon, obviously.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.320
The difference between dreamers and non-dreamers, it's the budget, it's when everything is accounted for in the elements of the programme!

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.600
There is a lot of spending in your programme.
Can you give us a number,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.380
because I assume that you calculated it?
In expenses, how much will it cost?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.080
- Do you have the number?
- JLM: Yes.
- Because when you're the head of State, numbers are important, or so I think.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.480
JLM: Of course, the time for numbers will come, don't worry.
