00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.260
I think the council of December 15th made the world a more dangerous place, since it encouraged violence.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.720
First, as far as immigration is concerned, you decided to deal with the control of arrivals

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.740
by entrusting them to two violent and obscurantic guards: the leaders of Turkey and Libya.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.960
As far as Russia is concerned, you decided to maintain absurd sanctions that prolong an irresponsibly tense situation.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.100
And you now intend to enforce an agreement on Ukraine that was rejected by the Dutch people.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.200
After Brexit, you basically advocate war against Russia as the EU's only common project.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.960
My country already rejected the European Defense Community project in 1954,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.100
and let me tell you that it is a fantasy to think that we would let you use the threat of our nuclear button in your chaotic meetings.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.600
All your Atlanticist and pro-NATO statements show you're overwhelmed with the situation,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:03.020
because Mr. Trump decided that the new opponent of Europe and the USA was China.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.660
If you want to make Europe stronger, then make the people stronger,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.460
unite the peoples through social progress,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.460
and through a vision of the future that consist in something else than finance and war.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.420
Elections will soon take place in France and Germany.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.400
I hope it will be the opportunity to make a proposition for Europe that is different from the Europe that you've created.
