00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.460
First measure: influencing the price of drugs,
and consequently the public division of drugs.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.760
It will take time, but I have to explain, don't I?

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.640
Once you paid the supplemental, the over-supplemental health insurance and all the rest, what's left to pay?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.840
There's €16 billion left to pay!

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.340
So I need to find €16 billion—not including the drop in  drug prices—to reach 100% Social Security reimbursements.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.240
How will I do this? First, we'll forbid doctors from imposing excess costs.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.700
€8 billion!

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.940
Secondly,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.180
—they shouldn't try me too much!

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.440
Let's tell it like it is, they invented this horrible thing called the "numerus clausus"

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.920
and the result is that we lack medical students.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.860
When you want to study medicine today, you're forced to attend a prep school, and your parents have to pay for it,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.020
whereas before you could directly enter the first year, but now if you didn't attend a prep school...

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.800
—you know, the prep schools where the guys who conceive the exam teach—

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.160
...then you can't become a doctor.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.200
And this invention resulted in the fact that few people are capable of doing medical interventions, specialists in particular.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.720
Besides, they all go to the same place, which is why there are medically undeserved areas.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.080
And that's why—it's a small proposition—we will organize public health care.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.380
With public healthcare centers and doctors employed by the state.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.520
Did you hear this abomination? Civil servants!

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.380
Doctors who agree...

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.620
—and there are plenty of young people who agree to do that!

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.340
There are lots of young people who agree to live this life!

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.760
The proof is that young doctors often work in collective offices.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.860
So it must be possible, right?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.100
It will not be an obligation, but those who want to will have the possibility to do so.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.980
And this will enable us to cover the whole territory, and consequently to treat diseases and patients in time,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.940
and doctors won't be forced to do a consultation every quarter of an hour to treat everyone.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.280
A lot of doctors make extraordinary efforts, you know? But this is absurd!

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.480
How did they put themselves in this situation?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.220
So we refuse excess costs!

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.820
It will enable us to save €8 billion.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.700
Then... —Early on, I spoke about supplemental health insurances.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.000
These people keep explaining that the public sector is expensive and that the private sector is wonderful, you know?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:28.680
The result is that the management fees of supplemental health insurances cost €6.5 billion.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.240
€6.5 billion!

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.840
To make a comparison, there are 8 % of management fees with Social Security,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.380
whereas with private insurances, management fees are from 18 to 25 %!

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.180
In other words, supplementary health insurances are more expensive than Social Security.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.440
In addition to this, we will of course hire employees from private insurances in the Social Security personnel,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.040
—and doing so will enable everyone to work more serenely—

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.360
it represents an economy of €6.5 billion to add to the €8 billion I just told you about, which makes €14 billlion.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.400
Now when my comrades did the math, they discovered

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:13.480
that supplemental heathcare insurances benefitted from a €3.5 billion exemption from Social Security contributions.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.260
I'll take them back!

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.060
And this makes... Well, it makes a little more than we need: €17 billion.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.080
So we shouldn't say it's not possible.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.440
So...

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.700
They did the math, because they think: "Mélenchon he says things, but..."

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.660
But no, Mélenchon is a careful guy!

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.640
And... they often make mistakes when it comes to me...

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.820
They believe that we were born yesterday, and since we don't have any money, they think that...

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.800
But they don't get it!

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.240
I am surrounded by lots of people who actually work, organize and prepare things, and I'm their spokesman!

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.540
They are volunteers, but listen people, volunteers are not amateurs, you know?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.980
They don't seem to get it!

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.800
Volunteers are people who know and do their job!

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.080
And they do it for other people most of the time, because they're paid for that!

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.740
And those who do the math for right-wingers or for guys from the Socialist Party,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.980
well sometimes, they share our ideas, they're with us!

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.740
Yes they are! So what do they do?
Well they tell us about it!

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.840
They explain to us how they do it, how they proceed.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.820
And they're everywhere! Ha ha. Everywhere!
In the most improbable jobs.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.520
In the army, in the diplomatic corps, everywhere!
Our opponents don't think it's possible, but it is!

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.820
There are people who give us a hand, so we use bulletproof figures!
