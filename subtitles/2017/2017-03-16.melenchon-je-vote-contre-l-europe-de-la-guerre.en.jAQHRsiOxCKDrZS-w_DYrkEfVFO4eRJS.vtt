00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
I vote against this bill because it aims at bypassing the obligation of a treaty

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.980
that would need the approval of Europeans for establishing this absurd Europe of war that you are preparing.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.920
I am alarmed at the binary vision of this bill

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.880
that opposes—for unknown reasons—a so-called Asian area to a Euro-Atlantic one.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.120
I worry about the fact that you already set up a military Staff,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.200
and all the more so because this report claims that we should prepare to high-intensity conflicts,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200
in other words, war.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.340
By the same token, it says NATO networks should be strengthened.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.920
I think you are completely wrong about what the European project should be. It should be a peace project.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.160
You should be asking yourselves how could Europe be more efficient in securing peace in the world,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.700
rather than wonder how it could contribute to spreading wars

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.360
and spark hostilities everywhere, whereas Eureope should prevent them at all costs.
