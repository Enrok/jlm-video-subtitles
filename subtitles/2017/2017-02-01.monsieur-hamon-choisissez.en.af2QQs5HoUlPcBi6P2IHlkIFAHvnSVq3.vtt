00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
Hello. I come before you to speak that way because I see,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.240
as you do, that the campaign

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.040
for the presidential election for which I stand

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.100
is hitting big turbulence, and that this is worth thinking about it.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.020
You have seen that after Mr Juppé and Mr Sarkozy were eliminated from this election,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.880
and after the current president of the republic had to give up

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.220
the idea of defending his record in front of french people,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.120
now it is Mr Fillon's turn to be himself in turmoil.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.720
And a lot of watchers think that, in a few days from now, his role will become untenable,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.980
considering what the medias and legal investigations blame him for.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.500
We are obviously entering an area of huge turmoil, and the elimination of Mr Valls last sunday completed the picture.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.080
What's up now ? I think everyone can easily see it :

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.300
in both of the political parties, there is a trend

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.560
that kicks out the people who are responsible for the situation we're in today.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.360
This wave is terribly powerful

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.140
and anyone who tries to oppose it will be washed away. And that's fine !

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.860
We need to open positives outlooks but no one will do something against this general wish expressed today

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.300
In my case, I choosed my side a long time ago, and you know it

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.240
Some blamed me enough for saying "We vote, they get out"  So, it prickles a bit, but we have to admit that

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.000
it deals with the state of mind of french people which manifests itself wether in Right than in the Left

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.820
At this point, after the elimination of Mr Valls, Mr Benoît Hamon speaks to me and says that he gives me a hand

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:00.300
I'm glad to hear it, because generally it change with what i experienced the last 10 year, when no one speaked to me with this tone.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.620
I also noticed the amount of word from my vocabulary and my program that he retook and i'm glad.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.340
I consider that it moves the ideas forward and i don't reclaim any copyright

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.620
on the contrary, more we share, more i'm happy i always said it, i think a lot of people think my way

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.820
Do we have to speak to each other? Of course we have to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.700
Me, i'm partisan of a republican exercise of trade and dialogue, we should be able to speak to each other, in this country.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.780
You see when i come to a city as Tourcoing to hold a political meeting

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.760
Or Toulouse where i held a Picnic As well as Périgueux.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.020
The Mayor of the city is not from my side and we dot not have the will to change our minds

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.780
However we meet and we speak

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.140
And I am received gentlemanly in these cities

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.480
So , particularly

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.900
I think that it has to be possible for me

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.600
to speak with Benoît Hamon,  that i have know as a student union responsible,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.640
as a leader of the Socialists' Youth Mouvement (MJS)

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.120
And later on as a minister

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.600
As a result, there is nothing against talking to each other.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.000
but, this case is not about personal relationships, this case is about real content:

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.680
what side do we chose for the next years and how are we going to manage the country from the 2017 election.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.660
I ask that everyone thinks about it, we are not making a party conference

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.620
we are preparing the election for a historical period

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.560
in which France will be playing a big part, on great topics:

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.080
international trade agreements,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.920
european treaties,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920
We are asked all these questions.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.360
We have to take it on with order, method, and absolutely clear points of view

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.960
and no double talk

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.000
No one in this country wants to be played a second time like the time of the "Bourget" speech ( from the yet to be elected president Hollande in 2012)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.680
that is to say a great speech, extremely flattering to hear, followed by exactly opposite actions.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.680
Benoît Hamon who is the winner of the PS' primary (socialist party) speaks to me.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.780
I watched carefully what he asked me.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.160
I clearly saw that he has no intention of questioning his candidacy.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.700
He does not put it in discussion between each other

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.840
Well!

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.440
He settled it during an interview with Mr Bourdin

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.740
so I ask you to watch the following sequence, instead of saying it myself, he might as well say it with his own words

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.520
Here it is!

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.780
Benoît Hamon: "You do not race for the presidency to make one lap around the track

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.200
I already said that during the primary"

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.640
Jean-Jacques Bourdin: "You will go all the way?"

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.000
Benoît Hamon : "I will go all the way, there will be a Benoît Hamon's ballot paper for the Presidential election"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Well,  you heard him, so ..

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.820
Now what is he offering me to form? a coherent governmental and parliamentary majority

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.080
So, I say with all my sympathy to Benoît Hamon:

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.240
it is not possible that you ask to me to form a coherent governmental and parliamentary majority,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.460
as you say, by mixing people who want to turn over a new leaf as we do

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.140
and people who are responsible for what is ON the old leaf

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.480
like the deputies that you intend to nominate for the upcoming Legislative Election at your party convention

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.400
because we will then be dealing with people about whom I ask you: how can we form a majority with them?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.760
since we fought them during many years.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.500
In facts, to be more practical

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.920
How can you form a majority to abrogate the "El Khomri " law WITH Ms El Khomri as a PS's deputy

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:38.300
How can you abrogate all the brutal acts done by the President of the PS's group Mr Bruno Le Roux WITH him as a candidate

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.100
How can you even imagine to change anything when you offer to make Manuel Valls re-elected as Evry's deputy

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.660
That is not serious,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.640
No one will believe that all of this could work together,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.040
Because it already did not work, together,  so far

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.860
I admit you voted to support the last François Hollande's prime minister

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.000
But, you cannot ask us to "do the splits" as you do

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.080
and that is not all

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.240
you ask us as well to create a coherent majority with deputies from your party who intend to elect Mr Macronas  president

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.320
But, nothing about this is actually serious

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.140
you cannot govern a great country with teams made with every old thing

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.240
Ones fighting against others during years, and suddenly meeting and kissing each other

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.240
Enough jokes, it's time for clarity!

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.260
So I ask Mr Hamon with much sympathy: Now, it's time to choose

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.300
There is a wave moving forward, so lean on it

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.500
Let it carry you.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.600
Choose, between them and us, choose

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.060
between the "kick-outist" wave and the rescue of the old world, choose

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.920
Choose and decide

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.780
Because WE will not change our mind

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.280
we want to move on

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.380
we want to move on to the sixth republic

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.100
we want to exit the european treaties

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.220
we want an ecologic planning

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.820
we want to exit NATO

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.580
and so on

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:18.700
we want to share wealth in a clear and sharp way in this country for those who've been robbed by the last two presidents the republic

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.740
We want life to change for these millions of poor people

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.840
homeless people, living in the streets who do not care at all about our arrangements

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.200
What matters for them is that life changes for real.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.340
and we will not change it by patching up the old world

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.640
But this is my point of view.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.800
you heard it, dear Benoît Hamon, I will listen to the answer you will give me on saturday,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.700
by investing or not those persons who cannot be part of the majority you offer us to form with you.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.980
we will never be part of such a crew anyhow

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.440
finally, for all of you who are listening, I look forward to seeing you this sunday in Lyon.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.620
I hope that as many of you as possible will be attending the meeting I'm organizing there

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.060
because this very day, in Lyon there will be, between the two rivers, the Saône and the Rhône

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.960
the two or three great thoughts that drive our time

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.740
Ms Le Pen's communitarianism, because that is what she does

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:22.780
indifference to other embodied by Mr Macron's liberalism, who offers "uberization" (from the Taxi Company Uber) for everyone

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.240
and our practice: humanism

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.360
A humanism of solidarity,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.880
cooperation instead of competition

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.300
and universalism, which means that we think all humans are similar

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.380
regarding their needs, and therefore are equals in rights in order to find an answer to their needs

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.280
This is what is at stake here.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.420
So I hope you will be numerous, in Paris aswell, it will take place in the Docks of Aubervilliers

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.160
My hologram will be there, so it will be for you the opportunity to discover what every one knows:

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:58.180
when human mind inovates, when we don't put skin color, religion or gender condition

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.640
the imagination is unleashed, and shares the knowledge, that's what science teaches us. And it makes me happy

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.800
Another word: on saturday, I will be in a little village in Haute Sâone called Champagney

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:21.680
I'm going there because in 1788, people in this little village as in some other little villages in France, having learned that

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.800
there was a slave trade, got indignant at it

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.540
And they wrote in their list of grievances and in their letter to the King

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.400
that people couldn't be treated this way because every human beings were similar

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:43.400
They use for the first time this word in the political vocabulary and they repeat it in their text

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:51.060
For our honour, they showed that when the french people had to express themselves about this question, they were against.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.860
And you will ask me: why this saturday?  Because it's the 4th of February

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:02.200
And the first abolition of slavery in France, in the huge revolution of 1789 was a February 4.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.500
And I would like it to be a red-letter day, this instant, this wonderful moment

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:14.920
It's our turn to be worthy of our elders. Let's not accept this social slavery that endure so many people in the country, who are suffering at work.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.820
Let's not accept the slavery of outcast, to which so many people are forced by unemployment

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.760
Let's not accept the sub-citizen condition of the people who don't even have an address because they live in the street

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.340
and don't have any possibility left to participate with the life of the community

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.060
This is what my presence on February 4 will mean and I'm happy to be able to tell it to you

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.720
So, well, untill sunday we will have the answers to my questions

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.880
I repeat it in case he didn't understand: Benoît Hamon, choose between us and them.
