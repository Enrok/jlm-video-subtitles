00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
Hello, I present myself in front of you this way, because I see as you do, that the campaign

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.580
for the presidential election in which I'm candidate

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.420
enters in a huge turbulence, and this deserves an afterthought.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.700
You have seen that after Mrs Juppé, Sarkozy were eliminated from this election,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.880
after that the president of the republic in practice had to renounce

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.120
to defend his past mandate in front of the French people,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.640
now it is Mr Fillon's turn to be himself in the turmoil,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.720
and a lot of watchers think that, in a few days from now, his position will become unbearable,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.840
given everything the media and the legal investigations say on him.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.160
Clearly, we enter a huge turmoil area, especially with the elimination of Mr Valls last Sunday.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.080
What's up now? I think that everyone can see it.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.000
Whether in a political party or in an other, anyway, there is a wave

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.360
that drives to kick out the the people responsible of the situation we're living nowadays.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.360
This wave has a terrible power

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.320
and anyone who would try to oppose it will be washed away by it. And that's fine!

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.260
We need to open positives outlooks but no one will do something against this general wish expressed today.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.300
In my case, I chose my side a long time ago,
and you know it.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.240
Some blamed me for saying "We vote, they get out".
So, it prickles a bit, but we have to admit that

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.000
it matches the state of mind of the French people, both on the Right and the Left.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.820
At this point, after the elimination of Mr Valls, Mr Benoît Hamon speaks to me and says that he makes a gesture to me.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:00.300
I'm glad to hear it, because it's a welcome change from what I lived the last 10 years, when no-one spoke to me with this tone.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.620
I also noticed the amount of words from my vernacular and my program that he borrowed, and I'm glad.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.340
I consider that it moves the ideas forward and I don't claim any copyright.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.620
On the contrary, the more we share,
the happier I am, I always said it.
I think a lot of people think my way.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.820
Do we have to speak to each other? 
Of course we have to!

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.700
Me, I'm partisan of a republican exercise of trade and dialogue, we should be able to speak to each other, in this country.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.780
You see when I come to a city like Tourcoing to hold a political meeting,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.760
or Toulouse where I held a Picnic as well as Périgueux,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.020
the Mayor of the city is not on my side and neither of us want to change our minds.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.780
However, we meet and we speak,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.140
and I am well-received in these cities.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.480
So, particularly

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.900
I think that it has to be possible for me

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.600
to speak with Benoît Hamon, that I have known as a student union responsible,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.640
as a leader of the Socialists' Youth Mouvement (MJS),

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.120
and later on as a minister.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.600
As a result, there is nothing against talking to each other.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.000
But this case is not about personal relationships, this case is about content.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.680
What side do we choose for the years to come and for the way of managing the country from the 2017 presidential election onwards.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.660
I ask to deliberate about it, we are not making a party conference

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.180
we are preparing

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.640
the election for an historical period

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.560
in which France will play a big part, on great topics:

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.080
international trade agreements,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.920
European treaty,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920
All these questions ends up on the table

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.360
We have to take it on with method, order and an absolute clarity of points of view

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.960
and no double talk

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.000
No one else in this country wants to be played a second time like in the "Bourget" speech ( from the yet to be elected president Hollande in 2012)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.680
that is to say a great speech, extremely flattering to ear, followed by exactly opposite actions

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.680
Benoît Hamon who is the winner of the PS' primary (socialist party) speaks to me.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.780
I watched carefully what he asked me.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.160
I clearly saw that he has no intention of questioning his application

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.700
He does not put it in discussion between each other

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.840
Well!

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.440
He dealt with it during an interview with Mr Bourdin

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.740
so i ask you to watch the following sequence, instead of saying it myself, he might as well say it with his own words

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.520
Here it is!

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.780
Mr Hamon: "You do not race for the presidency to make one lap around the track

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.200
I already said that during the primary

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.640
Mr Bourdin: "You will pursue to the end?"

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.000
Mr Hamon: "I will pursue to the end, there will be a Benoît Hamon's ballot paper for the Presidential election"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Well, you heard him, so...

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.820
Now what does he offer to form? A Governmental and parliamentary consistent majority

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.080
So, i say kindly to Benoît Hamon:

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.240
it is not possible that you ask to us to form a governmental and parliamentary consistent majority

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.460
As you say; by mixing people who wants to "turn the page" on the past as we do

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.140
with people who are responsible for what is ON the page

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.480
such as members of the National assembly that you want to nominate for the upcoming Legislative Election during your Party Convention

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.400
Because we will encounter people with whom I ask you: how can we form a majority with them?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.760
Since we fought em during year.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.500
In facts, to be more practical

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.920
How can you form a majority to abrogate the "El Khomri " law WITH Ms El Khomri as a PS's deputy

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:38.300
How can you abrogate all the brutal acts done by the President of the PS's group Mr Bruno Le Roux WITH hi as a candidate

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.100
How can you even imagine to change anything when you offer make re-elected as Evry's deputy Mr Manuel Valls

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.660
That is not serious,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.640
No-one will believe that all of this could work together,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.040
Because it already did not work, together,  so far

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.860
i admit you voted to support the last François Hollande's prime minister

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.000
But, you cannot ask us to "do the splits" as you do

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.080
and that is not all

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.240
you ask us as well to create a consistent majority with deputys from your party whom prepares to vote Mr Macron for president

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.320
But, nothing about it is actually serious

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.560
you cannot govern a great country with teams made of scraps and jetsam

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.240
Ones against others during years all the sudden meeting and kissing each other

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.240
Enough jokes, time for clarity!

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.260
So i ask to Mr Hamon with much sympathy: Now, it's time to chose

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.300
There is a wave moving forward, so lean on it

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.500
Let it carry you.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.600
Chose, between them and us, Chose

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.060
between the "go away" wave and the rescue of the "old world", Chose

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.920
Chose and decide

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.780
Because WE will not change our mind

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.280
we want to turn the page

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.380
we want to move on to the sixth republic

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.100
we want to exit the european treaties

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.220
we want an ecologic scheduling

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.820
we want to exit NATO

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.580
and so on

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:18.700
we want wealth sharing in a clear and sharp way in this country for those who were robbed by the last two presidents the republic

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.740
We want life to change for these millions of poor people

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.840
homeless people, living in the streets who do not care at all about our arrangements

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.200
What counts for them is life changing for real.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.340
and we will not change it, vamping the "old world"

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.640
But let's be honest, this is my point of view.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.800
you heard it, Dear Benoît Hamon, I will listen to the answer you will give me saturday,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.700
by investing or not those persons that cannot be part of the majority you offer us to form with you.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.980
we will never be part of such a crew anyhow

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.440
finally, for all of you listening and I look forward to seeing you this Sunday in Lyon.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.620
I hope that as many of you as possible will be in attendance for the meeting I organise there

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.060
because this very day, in Lyon there will be, between the two rivers , Saone and Rhone

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.960
the two or three great thoughts that gives soul to this era

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.100
Ms Le Pen's communitarianism, because that is what it is, communitarianism she does

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:22.780
indifference to other embodied by Mr Macron's liberalism, who offers liberalization for everyone

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.240
and our practice, humanism

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.360
With solidarity,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.880
cooperation instead of competition.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.300
and universalism, so to speak we think that all humans are are the similar

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.380
regarding their needs and from there are equals in rights to find an answer to their needs

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.280
This is the issues

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.420
So i hope you will be numeros, so in Paris aswell, it happen in the Docks of Aubervillier

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.160
There will be my Hologram, so it will be for you the opportunity to discover what ervery one knows.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:58.180
When human inovate, when we don't put skin color, religion or gender condition

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.640
the imagination is unleashed, and shares the knowledge, that's what science teach us. And it makes me happy

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.800
A word again: saturday eve, i will be in a little village in Haute Sâone whiwh is named Champagney

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:21.680
I'm going there because, the year 1788, people in this little village as in some other little village in France learned that

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.800
we were doing treaties of slaves, were unworthy to know it

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.540
And they wrote in their book of grievances and their letter to the King

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.400
That we couldn't treat people this way because all human beings were alike.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.820
They used for the first time this word ("semblable") in the political vernacular and they repeated it in their text.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:51.060
So well that they witnessed for our honor, the fact that when the french people had to express theirself about this question they were against.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.860
And you may ask me: why this Saturday?
Because it is the 4th of February.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:02.200
And the first abolition of slavery in France, in the huge revolution of 1789, was a 4th of February.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.500
And I would like to mark in red ink this instant, this wonderful moment.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:14.920
It's our turn to be worthy of our elders. We shall not suffer this social slavery that some people endure in the country, who are suffering at work.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.820
We shall not suffer the relegation slavery, to which so many people are constrained by the unemployment.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.760
We shall not suffer the sub-citizen condition of the people who don't even have an address because they live on the street

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.340
and don't have any way to contribute to the community.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.060
This what my presence the February 4th will mean and I'm happy to be able to speak about it with you.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.720
So, well, Sunday we will have the answer to my question.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.880
I'll repeat it in case he didn't understand: Benoît Hamon, choose between us and them.
