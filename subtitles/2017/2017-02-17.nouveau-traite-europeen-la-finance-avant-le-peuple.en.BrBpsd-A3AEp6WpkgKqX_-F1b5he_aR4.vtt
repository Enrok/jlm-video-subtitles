00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.480
This relation is marred by the same evil as the other two..

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.060
It claims to acknowledge the freedom of peoples provided that the freedom of money is protected.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.660
This is the ordoliberalism doctrine.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.960
I'd rather tell you that even though you keep pushing forward

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.660
the necessity of a Europe of war, labeled as "Europe of Defense"

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.940
to bring  European peoples together,
you will achieve nothing.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.870
As long as you refuse social harmonization,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.070
as long as you rebuke tax harmonization,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.450
as long as you reject independence from NATO,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.760
you only offering one prospect to people

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.071
— who, instead, want peace, social progress and independence—

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:40.631
you are leaving them with only one prospect, stated out loud:

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.900
"This Europe, we can either change it or leave it!"

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.820
What has started is not the expected positive change,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.740
But the fact is that people are beginning to leave it.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.280
Then, it is pathetic that your only response to the Brexit would only be

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.580
the "Europe of Defense"and the constitutionalization of the rights of finance.
