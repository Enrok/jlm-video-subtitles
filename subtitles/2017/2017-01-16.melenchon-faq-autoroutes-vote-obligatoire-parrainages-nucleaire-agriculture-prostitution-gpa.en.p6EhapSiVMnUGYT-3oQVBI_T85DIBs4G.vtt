00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
OK folks! We initiated a new FAQ, but we became victims of our own success.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.600
Why is that?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.760
Because you asked 5,000 questions in total. I'll skip the details of whether you asked them on Youtube or Twitter or whatnot.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.560
5,000 questions! 
I don't know how to answer 5,000 questions!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.100
So, we sorted and grouped them

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.940
and I won't even be able to answer all the questions I have in hand.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.980
So, I'm wondering how I'm going to do it.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.660
Should I give a written answer to the question I do not address here?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.340
But I would have to find the person who is willing to do that.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.780
So, do not take offense.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.460
Picking questions is now close to be a lottery.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.600
Of course we sort them by theme and then we look for the most straightforward questions.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.780
It does not mean that we resent others.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.280
It's just not possible!

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.960
How can someone physically answer 5,000 questions? It's not possible.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.320
So I took a few of them...

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.640
So, here for example. @FishK asked the following question:

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.900
"In your program, you are apparently in favor of both individual freedom, and the freedom of decision over one's body."

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.600
"(Right to abortion, assisted suicide)"

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.300
OK!?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.700
"But you are also against prostitution and surrogacy".

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.120
"These notions apparently contradict each other:"

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.780
"If I am free and have the freedom of decision over my own body, why would you forbid me to sell it or rent it?"

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.420
This is a logical question.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.720
It obeys a principle of formal equality.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.820
If you are free and have control over your own body,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.180
why could someone tell you: "You can do whatever you want, except this and that!"?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.460
Well let me tell you why.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.420
There is no such thing as absolute freedom,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.420
except the freedom of conscience, that is, the freedom to decide

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.760
All other types of freedom, no matter what they are, have limits.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.340
To be precise, there are domains in which they do not apply.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.520
For instance, you cannot drive at any speed in a street or in a city.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.960
This was an example.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.260
In a similar manner, the freedom of speech does not allow you to make racist comments

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.300
because it's not considered an opinion, but a crime.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.600
So total, unlimited freedom does not exist, except for the freedom of conscience.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
This is why my opinions don't contradict each other.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.520
I practice freedom, and I propose to exercise it in the usual framework.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.480
But you're right in saying that the decision to forbid this or that

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.380
contradicts the total freedom one could aspire to.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.400
Why is that ?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.360
It's because we are not alone.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.320
If we were, we could do whatever we want.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.940
But we're not, we live in a society.
Consequently, there are rules that apply to everyone.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.700
And those rules are legitimate because we all decided on them — in theory!

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.680
That is, we have a democracy, we decide on rules,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.280
and they apply to each and everyone of us once we voted.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.600
Once we voted, we made a decision,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.520
but it doesn't mean that you have to agree with this decision.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.740
You can keep having and defending your own point of view, as I do it here.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.940
For instance, someone who would say: "I defend the right that one has to propose sexual services"...

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.900
— some people defend this idea, and defending this idea is not forbidden.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.420
What is forbidden is to put it into practice.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.620
Well that's the law for now.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.660
And it's right

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.100
So the rule for me is that if each of us has the control over his own body, and more importantly over himself ,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.580
— it's not just about having control over our body, it's about having control over ourselves —

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.040
as is the case for abortion — the right to abortion to be precise, and not abortion itself —

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.520
— no one supports abortion, we support the right to abortion —

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.680
it's because we consider that people's body, women in this case...

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.440
Women's body are not the property of their husband,their children, or society.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.140
They have to be sovereign over their own body.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.780
— sovereignty means emancipation, they decide on their own.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.840
And in those conditions, I am opposed to...

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.180
— it's my political opinion, there is no rule of nature that confirms what I am about to tell you —

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.740
I am opposed to the commodification of the body, whatever the kind.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.660
So I am opposed to surrogacy, for instance, because surrogacy is always a trade.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.040
Don't tell me it's not!

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.860
Well there is always an exceptional case or two that contradict this,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.080
like a sister that gives birth for her own sister — I can understand that —

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:03.200
but I'm still waiting to see a billionaire who decides to give birth for a poor woman from a slum.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.720
If I ever see this happen, I'll agree with the idea that carrying a baby for someone else has become so natural and spontaneous

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.520
that it deserves to be reconsidered, but it has never happened until now.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.000
Surrogacy is a disgusting and immoral trade.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.840
It turns the body of surrogate mothers — who carry a child against money — into a mean of production.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.020
I don't agree with this.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.300
In the same way... the same logic,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.640
I am opposed to prostitution, which consists in selling one's body to someone else,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.740
and in the same logic, I am opposed to the selling of organs and blood.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.200
This is why I agree with the French system
— it's not the case in every country —

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.600
in which blood and organ donations are free.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.140
Someone's body should never become a commodity.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.120
This is the idea, and although there seems to be a formal contradiction,

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.180
it is the same thing from a logical, moral and philosophical point of view.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.960
So thank you @FishK for asking this very interesting, philosophical question.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.260
The next question is from @Shisui Uchiwa.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.160
"Do you think that making voting mandatory would be a good political measure ?"

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.780
Yes I do!

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.060
So, I have to explain this.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.760
Some people say: "No, it's an individual liberty, we can decide not to vote"

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.020
This happens in certain assemblies sometimes.
Those who don't want to vote raise their hand.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.200
But... the idea is that...

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.980
...it is necessary to decide.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.060
We need to make decisions.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.120
And to make the right decisions, we need to make them as collectively as possible.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.960
The more we are to think and give an opinion, the better the opinion.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.960
It's a...

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.420
...a wager.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.640
'Wager' is not the correct word but let's say...

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.340
It's the idea that we are more intelligent collectively than individually.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.140
Let's take an absurd example.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.700
Suppose everyone decides not to vote except one person: he rules and does whatever he wants.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.960
You see there's something wrong, here.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.600
This is why everyone's vote is necessary.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.800
And since it is necessary, then it's mandatory.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.040
So of course, it's not about making people vote for someone they don't want to vote for.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.920
Voting is mandatory.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.440
If you do not vote, you are punished...

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.960
through different means.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:38.440
But you should keep the right not to participate to take part in the vote in the sense that...

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:46.180
— "Listen, I really don't like any of the candidates, and my way to express my discontent is to cast a NOTA vote".

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.120
We have to take into account NOTA votes.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.080
But NOTA votes are not neutral.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.000
They're the expression of an opinion.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.840
They say: "I do not like any of those candidates!"

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.640
"The question that is asked in this referendum is not the right one,"

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.040
"and I do not agree with having a debate over this issue, so I'll cast a NOTA vote".

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.820
We have to count NOTA votes in the final result.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:16.160
We could even decide that a decision that was taken by a minority cannot be carried out.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.060
In other words, if 50 % of voters voted NOTA, then we consider that...

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.740
— since 50+1=51 —

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.080
then we consider that the vote is purely and simply annuled,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.900
because so many NOTA votes would be considered a political opinion.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.380
So it's important to be precise on all these points,
and I hope I was clear enough.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.500
Now the next question...

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.500
@Vivien Lyxoo — since there are two O's, I guess I should pronounce "oo"...

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.320
@Vivien Lyx00:

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:54.300
"What is you opinion on the 500 sponsors system that prevents some independent candidates to run for president?"

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.520
"If you are elected President of the Republic,
would you lower the required number of sponsors?"

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.440
"Would you repeal this 500 sponsors system?"

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.140
Or would you replace it with a different system?

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.620
Here is my answer.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.940
Of course, I am opposed to this 500 sponsors system,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.940
but you have to know why it was created to begin with.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.040
It was created in 1965,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.140
because it is in 1965 that direct universal suffrage was adopted for the first timee in France.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:29.800
There was several candidates, and some of them were considered "extravagant".

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.440
There was a guy, a very nice and respectable small business boss named Marcel Barbu,

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.320
and this guy would cry when he spoke on TV.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.140
He was emotional, because the issues he talked about...

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.260
— it was considered a strange thing to see this in a presidential election.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.580
At the time, TV was not as normal as it is now.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:57.360
Nowadays, it is not only normal, but people are individually accustomed to use images,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.540
by filming their family or themselves,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.060
so images no longer have the same petrifying effect as in the past.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:09.720
And... in fact, anyone can feel like running for President of the Republic,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.560
and I don't want to criticize this,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.260
but do all those who want to run for president have to do it...?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.460
So what kind of filter could we create?

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
Not this one, because it is the worst possible filter!

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.720
A candidate needs to be sponsored by 500 elected representatives in order to run for for president,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.940
and not all the elected representatives, but some of them!

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.680
Departmental and regional councillors, deputies, senators and mayors can do it.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.280
And mayors only, not town councillors nor deputy mayors.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.420
So this decision is absolutely individual,

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.960
but these elected representatives never asked anyone to give them this power.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.380
They are asked to guarantee the smooth democratic progress of an election.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.160
This is a huge responsibility!

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.300
I know small town councils that organized a vote to prevent the mayor from sponsoring a candidate.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.440
First, this is not a normal practice, and if every mayor did that, there wouldn't be any candidate at all!

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.860
So, the system that consists in being sponsored by "great representatives"

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.420
- I don't know why they're called like that because other representatives aren't unimportant -

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.240
is a bigwig system, meaning that bigwigs decide.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.900
This election is extremely monarchical to begin with...

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.360
It is a stunting election.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.460
They say that in the first round you choose, and in the secound round you elimiate,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.240
but these are just words, and the truth is that we end up with a democratically dreary result.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:38.180
So we can't continue with this system, but we can't say anyone can run for president either,

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.820
because it would be unmanageable,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:47.280
and it would allow weird candidacies, and I don't think it would be very funny.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.700
Anyway, we must put an end to this fixed election system.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:59.340
There was a proposition in a parliamentary report that had been written at Lionel Jospin's request

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.800
that was concerned with the democratization of the 5th Republic.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:10.360
I took this proposition over, and it said that if 150,000 citizens sponsored a candidate

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.380
then this candidate could run for president.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.060
These 150,000 citizens are supposed to give their ID and their poll card number.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.560
I don't think you can find 150,000 people just like that,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.980
but if you think this figure is too low, we can choose a higher one, that's fine with me.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.580
To me, this method is more democratic for the simple reason that you have to campaign to convince voters.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.880
If you're not even capable of convincing 150,000 people to sponsor you for an election,

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:42.460
then it's useless to stand as a candidate to an election, because you need much more than 150,000 voters to become president.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.880
You need millions of voters to become president.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.080
So this was my answer, but to be honest, I should add something.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:57.660
I advocate the establishment of a 6th Republic, and to do that, to write the new constitutional rule,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.320
we will have to convene a constituent assembly.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.880
So it won't be up to me the President of the Republic to say what's in the constitution,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.320
but it will be the task of the constituent assembly.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.080
I did my best to answer your question.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.820
The next question is from @Corentin Torres.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.300
"Mr. Mélenchon, my question is probably pointless, but I have been thinking about it for a while".

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.600
"What does the "phi" symbol mean to you? Why did you choose it as the symbol of your campaign?"

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.840
OK, so... I'll tell you the true story.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.880
I already answered this question, but I'll do it gain, because it enables you to clearly understand the idea.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.220
We were looking for a symbol that would encapsulate...

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.660
our slogans and the way we are.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.760
Traditional parties often have a symbol.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.520
For instance, the Communist Party's symbol is the hammer and sickle, it's...

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.040
It's an old symbol.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.700
The Socialist Party's symbol is the rose in the fist.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.000
Now the National Front's new symbol is a blue rose...

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.960
They borrowed it from the Socialist Party.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.760
There's a sort of stem that looks like a tombstone...

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.420
All the parties have a symbol, but what is the point of having a symbol?

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.460
Well it is supposed to encapsulate the spirit of a party,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.040
but above all, it is very useful because you can put them on ballot papers

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.760
and it enables voters to identify the ballots.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.120
Of course, the symbol had better have a meaning, otherwise people don't remember it.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.860
So there are symbols on ballot papers.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.880
We were looking for one.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.420
After we discussed it, we finally agreed upon one of them, but it wasn't the symbol I had chosen.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.620
We had the simple idea that the initial letters of "France Insoumise" (Rebel/Unsubdued France) were F and I.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.740
F. I. = FI

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.960
And there's a Greek letter called "phi".

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.200
It is the letter that you can see on our posters.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:02.080
So... we thought that this idea was great, because the Greek letter "phi"...

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.600
The European democracy was born in Greece.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.060
Secondly, the "phi" letter is the symbol of philosophy.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.040
"Sophia" means "knowledge" in Greek.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.540
And... Well...

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.940
It's a beautiful symbol, because philosophy means "love of wisdom".

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.400
It is the idea that we think about what we do and that we choose wisdom.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.200
It might be a bit pretentious, but what matters is the idea.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.840
Finally, the letter "phi" turns out to be the letter that corresponds to a figure

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.360
that represents the harmonious proportion in nature.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.620
This is a very strange thing to know, but it's the truth.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.460
1,61 is a proportion that exists in nature and when you encounter this proportion...

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.460
For instance...

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.740
It is called the golden ratio.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.440
For instance, take a series of photos or drawings or whatever you want, then show it to people,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:07.000
and statistically, most people will choose the paintings, drawings or photos designed with the golden ratio,

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.100
because the eye and the mind focus on things that are harmonious.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.880
So the letter "phi" represents the idea of harmony.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:23.560
And to us members of "La France Insoumise", harmony is above all the harmony between man and nature,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.200
between human beings and nature,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.940
but also the harmony in the relations between human beings.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.700
Equality is closer to harmony than the violence of the domination of some over others.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.060
The domination of some over others is not harmony, but violence.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.340
This is why the letter "phi" seemed so important to us.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.860
If you look at it closely, you see that we write it like that.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.760
You start by putting your finger on the paper, so the line is a bit thicker, and then you make a circle,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.980
and there is the "phi" letter.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.620
All those who went up to their last year of high school...

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.760
wrote this letter at least once in their life to indicate the philosophy course,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.300
since every student attends a philosophy course during the last year of high school, except in vocational education,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.560
in which it is replaced by a course called "civic, law and social education",

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.500
a course that I put in the curriculum back when I was the Minister of Vocational Education.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.700
That's all for the symbol of the letter "phi".

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:19.680
So...

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.100
@Gaëtan Thomas:

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.600
"How are we going to move from productivist to sustainable agriculture?"

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.140
"How do you intend to convince farmers?"

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:35.040
I'm not going to explain to you the whole plan to describe the type of agriculture we want to implement,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.040
but we can at least say that we will implement it!

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.740
So...

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:46.160
In a way, we are going to meet a demand.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.380
We are going to organize this demand step by step.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.380
For instance, we are going to decide that the whole catering industry

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.380
- we'll begin with school canteens and then we'll take care of the rest -

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.360
has to use products from organic farming.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.960
Of course, we will have to find a definition of what is and what is not organic,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.820
and this definition has to be strict enough to control the agricultural production.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.400
Of course, you understood that this could not be done in the blink of an eye, which is why you asked this question.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.820
But you focused on the issue of how to convince farmers.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.840
To be honest, this is no longer a problem,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.220
because most farmers are already convinced.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.120
It's just that they cannot move to organic farming. Why is that?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.980
It's because they're all heavily indebted,

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.580
because they were encouraged to adopt a productivist farming model that prevents them from backing off.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:46.000
They have to pay, so they're forced to produce huge quantities of food that are determined in advance,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.860
and whose conditions of production are often imposed by those who lent them money

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.900
to produce these huge quantities of food.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.760
So we will convince farmers using two methods.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.400
First...

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.060
we'll make sure that the demand meet the offer,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:11.940
meaning we will ask organic production for the catering industry, it's the example I used.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.360
We'll pay for it, of course.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.120
And we'll increase the number of organic farmers.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.100
But listen, this simply means that we'll  have to increase the number of producers, and not just organic farmers,

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:31.640
because what we call small size, ecological agriculture requires more workers.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:37.880
We calculated that we would need 4 M farmers to implement this agricultural model,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.420
but there are only 900,000 farms today, so you see that we'll need a lot of farmers.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.440
The increase in the number of farmers shall be as sharp as possible, but also progressive,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.200
which means that lots of students will register at agricultural high schools.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.340
A lot of young people already want to work the land, rear cattle and work in agriculture.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:06.260
I think that if people hear of the fact that from now on, thousands and thousands of jobs will be created,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.420
we should be able to find hundreds of thousand people who will start learning.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:15.400
So there will be a transitional period during which farmers will be able to change their production methods,

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.880
and they will, because we will examine each case individually to adjust production

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.400
and to face the problem of debts, although this won't be the hardest part.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.920
The most important aspect is to change production methods, because in the future,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:38.960
we could decide to implement a system in which we would call "organic food" all non-specific food,

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.020
and all the rest would be called "non-organic".

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.420
Let me tell you that the effect would be devastating!

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.880
Suppose you had to choose between two apples and that one of them is labeled "non-organic".

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.880
I bet you would buy the other apple.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.760
So there won't be any choice.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.360
There won't be any alternative to this decision.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.360
We will move to organic agriculture, period!

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.600
We will do it as we did the opposite before.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.920
They decided that we would move to productivist agriculture, period.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.680
They didn't say "Those who don't want, just keep doing what you did".

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.680
Those who wanted to do as before did it at their own risk,

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.960
and they often went through periods of great distress, of poverty and finally had to stop.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.520
This plan will create a lot of jobs and improve people's health.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.880
We can't keep dealing with the issue of food as we do it today.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.360
We can't keep saying "As long as the shelves of supermarkets are full, everything is OK".

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:38.440
I already told this anecdote several times, but it's a pity to know that in the 50's,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.180
an apple contained as many vitamins as a hundred apples today.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:49.020
In other words, if you want your kids to be as healthy in the future as I am now,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:54.520
they'll have to eat a hundred apples, whereas I just needed to eat one to get the same amount of vitamins.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.440
As you can see...

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:06.080
This example is a bit of a caricature, but it illustrates why junk food is absurd, because its effects are irreversible.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.940
Now there's a slightly more frivolous question.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.260
Two frivolous questions, actually.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.520
"Do you think pétanque (boules) should be an Olympic sport?"

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.440
Yes.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.020
Why?
I don't know!

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.760
I think it's cool.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.100
The way I see it, it looks like a sport.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.500
And if pétanque is not a sport, then what is a sport?

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.900
It requires agility and precision, things that...

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.620
What could I compare pétanque with? Archery maybe...

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.080
Anyway, it looks like a good idea!

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.100
Next frivolous question...

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.640
I said it was a frivolous question,

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.860
so no need to leave ten comments to reproach me for answering frivolous questions!

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.860
I know it!

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.540
Now...

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.980
I forgot to tell you the name of the guy who asked the question about pétanque!

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.860
His name is Lubin. Now I said it!

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.700
@Delubin

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.400
Good.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.280
The next question is from @LeSceptique.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.760
What a name!

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.840
It is spelled S - c - p...

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.360
S - c - p t - l - T - V

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.680
Well, dear ScptlTV, here is your question.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.220
"Where did you buy that coat? We've seen it since the beginning of the channel. It caught my eye."

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.440
First, it's not a coat.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.200
It's a jacket, all right?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.380
Please show some respect.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.500
Second, why is your question about the coat, and not about my shirt?

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.940
I also have a shirt.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.780
A white shirt.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.460
So I'll answer the question you did not ask:
"Where does the shirt come from?"

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.480
And maybe I won't answer the question about the coat,
because it's not a coat!

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.400
So, my shirt is a waiter's shirt.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.820
I wear them because waiters always have to remain neat and clean, although they run around all the time.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.120
Maybe you didn't notice,

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:00.000
but people in the hospitality industry are always running around, and yet they always look clean.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.900
If they weren't, you would not go back to the restaurants or the cafés they work at.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.920
I realized that,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:12.840
and I wondered how come I was always bathed in sweat when I was giving a speech.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.920
I must lose around 2 or 3 pounds per meeting...

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.180
— I regain them very quickly, unfortunately —

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.920
2 or 3 pounds of water.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.600
Therefore, I'd better wear shirts that look clean.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.080
That's why I buy shirts used in the hospitality industry.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.780
Why are they so different?
First, they're clean. Second, they're cheap.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.820
Third... I feel fine in these shirts.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.060
What shirt brand do I buy?

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.760
The brand is Braggard.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:53.000
And when you go to a Braggard store, you're asked to stand in line with professionals — that's what I do!

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.160
There's one on  Faubourg Saint Martin street.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.680
There are probably other stores, but that's the one I go to.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.420
As to the coat — although it's a jacket —

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.260
it is also a jacket for professionals.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.700
It is made out of moleskin.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.880
Moleskin is a fabric that was used to make SNCF train seats.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.780
The good thing with moleskin is that it can't get creased.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.580
For someone like me who's always on the road, in a car or in a train,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.920
well normally, it doesn't get creased.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.240
But it's not just any jacket!

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.520
It's not just any jacket!
It is also a jacket for professionals.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.520
It is a roofer's jacket.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.900
Roofers get on top of houses' roofs to cover them with tiles.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.820
This jacket is used by professionals who do a hard and dangerous job.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.280
It's very...

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.460
Roofers don't have much time...

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:56.580
Their jacket always has to be OK in order to find the key,

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.220
the tool or the hook they need.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:06.540
So this jacket suits intellectuals well, because it has large pockets.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.180
I sewed them to keep them tight,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.240
but usually, I put newspapers in them, or my notebook, or my pen and all...

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.480
There are pockets inside and on the chest,

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.080
and some models have special pockets for hooks,

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.260
but I chose the simplest model.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.840
I hope I answered your question.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:32.420
If you want to buy a roofer's jacket, all you need to do is look on Google

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.860
to find the stores that sell them and the companies that make them.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.340
I have two or three of them, and I think I'll buy some more,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.460
because I really like some of them.
These jackets are for professionals.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.360
"I will vote for you, mainly because you deal with ecoogy" — thank you! —

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.000
"and I'd like to know how you intend to phase out nuclear power?"

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.080
Well, it's simple!

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.860
In a way, all we need to do is take the decision!

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.720
And we have to do it quick, because we lost a lot of time.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.900
And of course, the more we linger, the more it will take time to do it,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.820
because there are two aspects to phasing out nuclear power.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.820
There's the stopping of nuclear production of electricity on the one hand,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:16.260
and this immediately raises a problem, because we have to replace it with renewable energies.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.520
100 % renewable energies must be our objective,

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.940
but you have to understand that we will do it progressively.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.260
I'm not going to tell you: "Listen, we're going to stop all the nuclear power plants in the country tomorrow,"

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.480
"and then we'll see".

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.660
We couldn't do that!

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.500
It could cause the collapse of the electricity network.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:40.320
When we close a nuclear power plant, we have to have the steady equivalent of energy production.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.360
So it's all about planning.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:48.940
Planning means organizing and connecting decisions and the means to carry them out.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.040
That's the way we'll do it.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.720
Once we stopped a nuclear power plant,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:01.380
— which means that we've replaced it with renewable energies — then we have to dismantle it,

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:09.080
and let me tell you that it is one more reason to massively fund nuclear research.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.240
Why? Because we need to cool nuclear waste.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:22.160
We'll have to wait several thousand years before nuclear waste's radioactivity decays.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:28.700
The only way we can cool nuclear waste is to fund nuclear research, it won't cool on its own.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.340
So it'll take time.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.140
It'll take time, and that's precisely the problem.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.060
As to dismantling a nuclear power plant, it is a very complicated operation.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.940
Everything that is dismantled has to be transformed into waste,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:49.920
and this waste has to be as harmless as possible, although completely harmless waste doesn't exist.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.360
So that's the way we'll proceed,
and that's not the easiest part.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.200
And contrary to what some simpletons say,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.860
phasing out nuclear energy doesn't mean we'll have to use candles again.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.400
On the contrary, we'll have to make huge technological leaps to replace it,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.280
but let me reassure you, we know how to do this, we can replace it with renewable energies.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.800
Our problem is neither finding renewable energies,

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.840
nor how to make them work effeciciently enough according to our needs.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.260
Our only problem is to organize the phasing out of nuclear energy.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.640
Renewable energies already are available.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:30.960
For instance, the motion of the sea contains 75 times the energy that our planet needs

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.860
to keep our civilization of waste going.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.400
As you can see, it's not so complicated.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.840
Our problem is not to find the means.
Our problem is to carry them out.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.300
So we can do this, and we will.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.180
Now...

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.540
Now @WALDURCK and @MrShadow649 have a question.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.080
@MrShadow649 is the friend of @MrShadow648.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.420
And he's also the friend of @MrShadow650.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.160
Enough with jokes.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:04.880
So...

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.980
"What is your opinion on the current state of education?
What changes would you make?"

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.240
And @MrShadow649's question is:

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.540
"Mr. Mélenchon, I couldn't find any clear measures on education in your program".

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.180
Well...

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.320
"Could you explain them in details in your next FAQ video?"

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.780
Well, no. I can't.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.300
To do that, I would need to give a whole speech.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.560
But I'll take your criticism into account.
If you made it, it means that you have questions.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.500
If you don't understand our program,
then we'll have to do it more seriously.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.780
We'll discuss this as soon as the booklet on education comes out.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.280
Because a booklet on education will come out.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:47.780
The program you know, "L'Avenir en commun" (Common Future) does not answer every question right now.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.840
It deals with every domain, but it did doesn't go into details,

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:58.920
so there wil be booklets about each domain
— and I don't mean that education is a detail!

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:05.400
To us, it is the core of society's good functionning with social security, that protects people.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.220
Education is the core of human beings' development.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.880
Here's another question — could someone use a French name, a name I could read at a glance?

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.080
D- A - W - S.
I guess I should pronounce"Daws"...

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:18.960
Come on , please...

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.820
This is a nice pseudonym, but it's not easy to read!

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.100
So: "Hello Mr. Mélenchon, do you think highways should be nationalized? Why?"

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:38.280
This is a good question, because we forgot about the fact that the privatization of highways was a scandal!

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:46.600
All the French paid for these facilities — at least those who had a car, everytime they stopped at a tollbooth!

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:54.080
I know there's an ecological criticism that consists n saying that the more highways, the more cars,

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.540
and of course, the more cars, the more pollution.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:04.300
And above all, the more cars, the more we need highways, and so on.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.440
So we clearly see that this is a vicious circle,
but for now, we still have these highway companies,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:15.220
and everyday, people keep paying for the profits of these companies when they stop at a tollbooth

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:23.120
To me, when the time comes, our majority MPs will have to create a parliamentary commission of inquiry

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.380
in order to shed light on the reasons why and the conditions in which highways were sold,

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.680
and on the problems caused by this sale.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:36.440
There are lots of politicians that say that this privatization was a scandal.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:42.260
Highway companies raised toll rates but they didn't make any additional investment.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.580
Highway companies are like other companies — and some of them were very straightforward!

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.100
They said they would put money for five years in order to pay off their investment,

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:56.220
in other words, to yield the highest returns they could get, but they did not intend to make investments at all.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.240
This is why I intend to nationalize highways,

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.980
because highways were everyone's property,

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:10.500
and to me, they were sold at an absurdly cheap price.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:16.260
It's not possible to assess the price of something at a given moment

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.180
when it is supposed to function for 20 or 30 years.
This is an illusion.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.300
The market price my foot!

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.980
And what is the market price of Mont Blanc?

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.560
You don't know it? Well there you are!

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.480
Some do apparently!
They would be capable of selling Mont Blanc!

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.920
Now I'll conclude with two questions.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.640
These questions are very important for my staff!

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.640
The first question...

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.520
...is from @Atsuhikodji.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.500
Thank you for choosing a simple pseudonym!

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.300
@Atsuhikodji and @T B Nax.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.860
@Atsuhikodji asked:

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.460
"What is the name of the cat..."

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.620
"...that appeared in your last video?"

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.400
I like this question.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:14.040
I expected the next question to be "What is the color of Henri IV's white horse?" (famous French expression),

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.660
but no, @Atsuihikodji asked for the name of the cat in the last video.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.040
And @T B Nax's question is:
"What is your cat's name? :-)"

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.640
And there's a smiley face emoji at the end.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:34.380
This emoji is a bit old-fashioned, because it is composed of colons, a hyphen and a bracket.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:39.340
You should know that there are automatically generated emojis now.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.680
You should keep up on emojis @T B Nax!

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.460
OK, so... it's written — this is not a joke! —

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.180
@A communist: "I have a very serious question..."
— so the guy had fun!

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.960
"What is the cat's name?"

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.620
So the cat is an important subject for you.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.780
I promise that we'll give it some deep thought!
