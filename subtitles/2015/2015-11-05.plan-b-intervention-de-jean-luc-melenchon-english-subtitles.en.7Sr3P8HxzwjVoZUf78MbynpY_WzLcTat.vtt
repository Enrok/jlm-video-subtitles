00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.680
What a nice surprise&nbsp;!

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.860
Thank you

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.760
Well done to all of you outside

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.960
who have had the patience

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.120
to stay and listen in the rain

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.120
a warm welcome to you.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.480
Friends, before I start

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.620
and on your behalf,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.640
let me honour and give a heartfelt welcome to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000
Sinem Muhammed, co-president of Rojava and Kobané

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.940
the capital of the anti-fascist struggle in DAESH

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.560
Resistance&nbsp;! Resistance&nbsp;!

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
I also honour and welcome Leyla Buran representing the Yezidis women

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.680
who are being tormented by the DAESH

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.800
Once again, dear friends and comrades

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:32.640
this event ‘Fête de l’Humanité’, whose organisers I thank, has been a moment of high importance in our shared history.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.600
It is here that we built the first foundations of our Front de Gauche (Left Front)

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.040
It is here that we went through all the stages of our political structuring together…

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.880
which has not only a national mission

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:01.560
and I hope that today, more than ever, you realise that you are not just the protagonists of a few local elections

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.480
you are the protagonists of History with a capital H&nbsp;!

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.240
History made by women and men who feel they have a responsibility with regards to the human common good.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.880
You are Europeans&nbsp;!

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.360
You are citizens of the world&nbsp;!

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.560
The world is teetering on its edge and your actions will determine to which side it turns

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.040
Remember that every single one of us is personally responsible for the outcomes to events

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.360
depending on whether we face up to them with courage

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.640
or whether we hide ourselves behind pedantic political squabbles, whinging and whining

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.400
What a strange day it is today&nbsp;!

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.240
And you out there&nbsp;! The reds&nbsp;!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.440
Your hearts always filled with joy,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
with enthusiasm, always ready to forgive all the mistakes of the past…

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
I saw you&nbsp;! You heartily applauded a Labour General Secretary&nbsp;!

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.000
That doesn’t seem like you&nbsp;!

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.380
But…. you are right to do so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.560
Because it’s important to believe that although ‘one swallow does not a Summer make’, it can at least make Summer come sooner.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.800
What a rotten Labour party, that of the Blairites

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.320
which destroyed the whole European progressive movement&nbsp;!

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.640
Papers signed by Blair, Schröder, to humiliate German workers

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.600
the bastion and the most well organised of Europe’s working class.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:56.460
It’s Blair with Schroder, and later with Papandreou, and all those quitters who humiliated all the workers of Europe

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.020
So destructive were their decisions that still today, ten years later

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.400
the situation of the working class in Europe is worse than what it was after the war&nbsp;!

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200
Those are the actions they will have to answer for when faced with History.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.780
That is what we refused to accept

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.900
I was happy to see you applaud Oskar Lafontaine earlier.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.780
Friends, that is the kind of strength of character we need.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.440
That man refused to follow Schroder – he resigned from his position and set up Die Linke.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.960
That’s where the impulse came from, that inspired us to create the Front de Gauche (Left Front)

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.240
We are, at each step of the way, the inheritors of a History much larger than the history of just our own country

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.080
You heard these men speaking to you earlier

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.940
They are finance ministers of their countries

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.300
So I ask that we look at the results, logic against logic, programme against programme

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.880
Why should we believe those who applied a programme that has been a failure everywhere&nbsp;?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.560
One that has created poverty and decline, both moral and social decline of so many millions of people&nbsp;!

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.500
instead of these men here who have proposed another system&nbsp;?

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.820
Reason is on our side. Reason, not ideology&nbsp;! Reason&nbsp;!

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.500
We are not presenting a ‘plan’ for our country.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.300
We are not presenting a ‘plan’ for the left

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:40.920
We are presenting a plan for the common good of 450 million people in the European Union

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.100
One has to have one’s head in the stars to be able walk in the mud&nbsp;!

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.440
But, you must be vigilant and often less naive

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.760
Take a minute to think about it.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:10.340
Even though you say you are, and you are, sensible people

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:19.660
that you have lived long enough to know that sometimes one must make compromises,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.420
for the compromise to be viable there must first be a power struggle

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:34.080
Without a power struggle there should be no signing compromises, compromises that are a sign of capitulation

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:56.040
Now, try to understand, by unravelling the string of your own past, what really happened

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.040
The European Union, the way it was supposed to be, is dead

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:17.840
The European Union is a political corpse for us, for the powerful, it’s a straight jacket designed to keep the people and their movements strapped down.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
And we&nbsp;! We that are making History

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.540
We that embody the desire for peace, desire that inspired women and men in History

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.840
we that wanted a Europe of peace, we that wanted it since the Great Revolution of 1789

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:42.260
we that wanted it just like Victor Hugo, who wished a United States of Europe

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:49.120
For us, the Europe we wanted cannot be the European Union that we have today

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.300
The common currency to which we can aspire cannot be the Euro

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.220
which today is simply a cage where our dreams are locked away and left to wither

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.520
All our hopes, including the most legitimate ones&nbsp;!

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.540
Look at how the situation has been reversed

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.240
look at how they lie, mislead you, trick and deceive you

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.100
Today, they show you thousands of refugees, and they ask for your kindness

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:26.820
of which you have so much, because you stretch out your hand to he who falls to he who doesn’t know how to go forward

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.620
But you’re not buying their playacting

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.980
Why do they only speak of their arrivals&nbsp;?

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.960
Why do they never speak of what has caused these thousands of people to leave their homes&nbsp;?

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.620
And what has pushed these people out of their homes&nbsp;?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.220
It’s the aggression of the European Union

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.400
Yes&nbsp;! The EU is responsible for the wars in which she participates&nbsp;!

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.220
and is responsible for imposing on all the countries of sub-Sahelian Africa

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.080
absolutely unconscionable contracts, that ruin local economies and cause countless people to move out

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:13.880
And please, please don’t just sit back and watch ‘exotic-looking’ refugees from a far

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.380
 

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.220
I’d like to remind you of the consequences of these policies on the Europeans themselves

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:26.580
Because until now, the greatest population movement we’ve seen take place in Europe

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.740
is NOT the arrival of Syrians, nor the arrival of the Eritreans

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.760
but the forced departure of 500&nbsp;000 Greeks from their country&nbsp;!

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:50.780
Of which 120&nbsp;000 arrived in Germany, where hands were openly rubbed together upon receiving such highly qualified workers

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.300
Just as hands are rubbed together when all those English speaking Syrians arrive

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:03.540
because you see them on television explaining their misfortune to us, which means they belong to the educated middle class of their country

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.020
who in turn finds itself deprived of its elite

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.480
500&nbsp;000 Greeks&nbsp;! 1 million Spaniards&nbsp;! who have had to leave their country

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.720
in under a decade due to the absurd austerity policies

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.540
These are the biggest population movements&nbsp;!

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:29.720
so much so that Europe’s hypocrisy affects the entire world, provoking a bitter laugh from our friends in Latin America

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:36.560
Evo Morales says Europe keeps sending them immigrants and pushing their people out&nbsp;!

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.740
The irony is great&nbsp;: they spend thier time inventing new legislation against job seekers

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.240
while we spent our time trying to make new legislation to give them jobs over here&nbsp;!

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.860
That’s what’s happening&nbsp;!

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
This is what inexorably leads to catastrophe&nbsp;!

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.920
Because on this downward slope we cannot expect anything other than a catastrophe

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.640
You know that I don’t like to paint a black picture

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.820
I’m not an orator who relies on people being motivated through fright

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.160
I’m the total opposite

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.120
I want to say that every challeng we’re faced with is an opportunity to be inventive and creative

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.400
elevate ourselves to something greater, my friends and comrades&nbsp;!

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.320
Well, the challenge is so great

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.840
that we have before us an enormous opportunity to invent something radically new and we have to get started

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800
But before you must understand that the first condition is democracy&nbsp;!

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.040
If we pursue with Europe against and without the people

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.800
it will fail – it has already been tried several times and it fails each time.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.020
Well now we are witnessing a repeated series of violent strikes against democracy.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.560
Maybe you are aware of it but maybe others aren’t.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.980
Everything started in 2005

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.040
when they gathered all the old texts together with a view to write up a new Constitution

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.620
replacing the one that founded the European Union

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.380
After some unbelievable blackmailing

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.900
the French had been told that if they rejected the Constitutional Treaty,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.320
they rejected the whole method of building the EU which had been used up until then

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.720
Well the French did reject the Constitutional Treaty

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.460
And they made their decision very clear

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:24.940
And then, at the time the recently elected president Nicolas Sarkozy betrayed the French people

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.340
who had voted ‘No’, by transforming their ‘no’ into a ‘yes’ – that was the Lisbon Treaty.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800
After which came the next man

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.920
Who promised that he would renegotiate the Fiscal Treaty, remember&nbsp;?

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.240
The Fiscal Treaty is the straight jacket in which we are suffocating

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.720
And remember me, poor devil

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.900
rying to explain to the listeners in Montpellier during twenty minutes

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.240
how the European Financial Stability mechanism works

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.100
And you watched me and said to yourselves

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.760
‘maybe he will talk to us about something else, to finish with’.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.740
At the time France was debating a totally improbable subject

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.480
Halal meat&nbsp;!

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.560
That’s what the media was talking about&nbsp;!

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.320
Instead of talking about things that directly concerned us

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.080
Well friends, remember this

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.320
it’s because democracy has been violated twice

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.560
because François Hollande had promised to revise the Fiscal Treaty

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.660
Now, just for a moment, try to imagine that you are Mrs Merkel

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.200
She sees the French President, whose people voted ‘No’

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.380
and he says to her ‘oh, don’t worry, we cut everything up into pieces

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.280
throw it up all in the air, as it all falls down

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.440
we just pick it up, stick it all back together again and there we have our Lisbon Treaty

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.960
So she looks at him and says to herself ‘Gosh, this chap’s rather frantic&nbsp;!

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.080
Well, alright then, he says the French said ‘Yes’ although they voted ‘No’, fine with me.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.240
The next one comes along

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.200
The one who said he’d renegociate everything

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.440
He comes along ‘Hello, how are you&nbsp;?’ ‘Fine thank you&nbsp;!

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.320
So she asks him in German ‘Is that all you have to say&nbsp;?’

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.300
‘Yes yes&nbsp;!.. Oh I forgot, we need a stimulus package’

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.780
And that’s how out of nowhere Europe found out that François Hollande obtained a stimulus package of 120 billion euros

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.920
of which 60 already existed in the European budget and the other 60 to be borrowed from somewhere

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.720
So of course they told him ‘Yes yes&nbsp;!’ The entire Europe laughed at France

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.940
They thought it was us, the people, who agreed with this joke

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.480
And to realise the extent of the joke

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.440
can you imagine 120 billion euros

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.200
the ECB (European Central Bank) banker didn’t borrow anything from anyone

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.600
and he decided to put 1000 billion euros on the table&nbsp;!

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.840
of which nobody here ever saw a cent&nbsp;!

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.420
Because it went directly back into the banks

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040
from the European Central Bank straight into private banks

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.640
who in turn immediately put all of it into the financial bubble

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.940
There is not a single screw or nut in Europe that was made with that money

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
not a single machine

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
There you have it

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.120
that’s the Europe we have before us&nbsp;: a continuous hoax

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.860
So you others out there, remind yourselves

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.520
How many times did you think it was exaggerated

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.320
How many said to me ‘Oh well it’s a symbolic violence’.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.020
Really ?!

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.040
And when the ECB decided to stop Cyprus’s cashflow

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.380
small country

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.440
my comrade François Delapierre - may he rest in peace

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.480
had called Moscovici a ‘bastard’ for having accepted it

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.240
And I…

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.200
I had said that Moscovici no longer spoke French

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.880
but spoke the language of Finance

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.980
And you know what they retorted&nbsp;?

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.280
You have become antisemitic&nbsp;!

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.380
That’s how low the level of debate is in this country&nbsp;!

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.500
That’s how you’re spoken to when you talk about real problems.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.720
Well in Cyprus, it has gone from symbolic violence to the most direct violence possible

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.340
and that, my friends and comrades,

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.960
in any other region in the world, when the cashflow to a country is stopped, prevent a country from accessing its ressources

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.600
is an act of war&nbsp;!

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.160
What the ECB did to Cyprus was an act of war&nbsp;!

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.400
And it’s an act of war, what was done to Greece.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
It’s a financial Coup d’Etat

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.240
It was not ‘symbolic’ violence.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:32.000
Those are the conditions in which Alexis Tsipras had to negociate

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.880
Comrades, friends

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.400
I’m not giving any lessons.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.360
The events are still so recent.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.800
The 5th July we were in the streets and we sang songs

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.480
There’s one that maybe you recall

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.440
The chorus was

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.440
and we says "bis, and we says "bis"

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.900
and we says "bis", Varoufakis

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.840
tralala’

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.640
One week later our comrade Tsipras signs.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.120
We are not giving any lessons

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.960
We first protested against his decision

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.400
Because it was not a free decision&nbsp;!

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.200
When 18 people keep you in a room during 17 hours

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.440
to negiotate in a hostile manner

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:33.520
making you sign a document in which they control everything down to the price of milk, of meat and of bread

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.260
it’s quite simply an act of humiliation&nbsp;!

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.280
It is not a free agreement

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.360
Tsipras’s agreement is no free

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.760
 

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:52.160
Tsipras’s agreement is no freer than the agreement comrades were forced to sign

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.440
making legal working hours go up from 35 hours to 39 hours

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.400
An agreement is not a free agreement

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.760
if you sign with a gun pushed against your head&nbsp;!

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.200
This violence is used all the time

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.440
What right has the Eurogroup to decide that Greece has to leave the Eurozone&nbsp;?!

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.300
There is not one single law that talks about one country coming out of the Euro,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.720
it’s important to remember that.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.960
Remember also that the Eurogroup has no Institutional status.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.440
Remember also  - and the proof comes from the Eurogroup itself,

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.260
because when they expelled Yanis Varoufakis from the meeting

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.760
Yanis said ‘why are you pushing me out&nbsp;?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.080
My country is a member of the Eurozone’

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.560
they told him

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.120
‘the Eurogroup has no status, the president decides what he wants, and you get out.’

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
That’s what happened.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.220
So&nbsp;?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.960
Where are those violin players who claim that Europe protects us with its big gun against our head&nbsp;?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.480
The ‘democratic’ Europe&nbsp;? Who beats up the defenseless&nbsp;?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.860
That’s their Europe

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.360
And they want us, under pressure, intimidated

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.340
they’d like us to shed hot tears of joy when they mention Europe

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.480
And you have the improbable President of the French Republic

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.140
whe declares that he’s had a brilliant idea

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.520
he’s going to create an economic governement

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.640
and suddenly in the night you wake up and jump joyfully out of bed

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.040
‘an economic government&nbsp;! Why didn’t we think of that before&nbsp;?!’

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.400
The Parti Socialiste has been repeating the same idea for the past twenty years

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.760
And of course, immediately, the Germans ask

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.680
‘what are they going on about&nbsp;?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.720
We won’t let that happen.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.160
And if one day you decide to install an economic governement, it will be to apply the European Fiscal Treaty.’

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.780
And anyway, this economic government exists already,

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.620
it’s called the European Commission

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.960
to which each nation has to present its budget before presenting it to its own parliament

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.680
That’s the only idea they have to show for themselves

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.360
With a parliament, if you please&nbsp;!

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.280
We’d create a new Assembly, and they would have the right to agree&nbsp;!

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.940
‘Wouldn’t that be magical votes&nbsp;?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.360
‘Yup&nbsp;! All the time&nbsp;!

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.960
They don’t even listen to the question

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.800
As M. Juncker has said&nbsp;:

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
‘whatever the question, the answer is yes

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.560
Yes yes yes

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.040
Well, many of us know that sometimes in life,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.600
one gets off to a better start when one says ‘no

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.960
Anyway, we heard the words that Mr Juncker said

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.700
He said&nbsp;: ‘There is no democratic decision against the European Treaties’.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:41.700
The day he said that, the President of the Commission told you

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.260
something you hadn’t dared tell yourselves

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.640
your republican homeland that refused the right to Veto at Capet (louis XVI)

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.500
is forced to accept the Commission's veto

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.240
on national budget

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.960
and your country is no longer independent

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.040
Friends, the freedom to say ‘yes’ is only valid if we’re free to say ‘no’.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.640
You can only say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ if you’re free

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.960
And that’s what ‘independence’ means

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.060
I am a partisan of French independence!

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.940
I am a partisan of independence for all the peoples of Europe !

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.800
It’s another name for ‘sovereignty’

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.160
Sovereignty begins in the hearts of each one of you

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.440
when you decide for yourselves what you want to become

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.880
In big things as well as in the little things

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.460
Sovereignty, according to the definition in anthropology

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.600
is the first act of a group of people to control its members and the territory it lives on

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.320
Sovereignty is the possibility for a population to make a collective decision

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.280
and it’s because the decision is made collectively, that the decision is applied to everyone

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:01.120
Democratic legitimacy comes from the ability to decide for ourselves and the ability for everyone to decide

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.000
But in this case, only a handful of people are making the decisions

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.920
28 people in a European Commission meeting, presided by Mr Juncker

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:15.000
The prerequisite for recovering the European ideal, is that France recovers her independence

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.360
I say ‘France’… is it only a french ideal?

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.400
Friends, because it was me who condemned the role of the German government

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.680
before anyone else did, (for which I received some not-so-pleasant remarks)

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.500
since then many have realised I was right and want to make me into some kind of Germanophobe

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:39.160
And this is despite my friendship, since the origins of my party, with Oskar Lafontaine, who is German

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.160
And this is despite me and Oskar’s strong union against the European oligarchy

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.540
and against the direction of the CDU-CSU government, through Die Linke

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
I want for my country the same as I want for the others

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:59.660
And if we want to be heard, we need to assert our resolute will

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.660
We need to create a power struggle

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.500
I have to raise my voice, friends and comrades

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.240
because&nbsp;I aspire to govern this country with you, as much as you do

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.800
And I want everyone to know, beyond all borderlines

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.160
that I WILL CONCEDE TO NOTHING!

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.440
It has to be known!

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:34.920
I need them to know that although they were able to threaten Alexis Tsipras

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.320
because the Greek economy is 2% of the European economy

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.200
they will NOT be able to threaten a French ruler that resists

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.440
because France is 18% of the European Economy – about as much as the German economy

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.040
And as Yanis Varoufakis said earlier

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:59.740
If they start nitpicking too much, we can always say&nbsp;:&nbsp;‘we’ll stop paying’

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.800
Because as Yanis Varoufakis said earlier

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.600
if the Greek gouvernent had said

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.300
listen, we’ve been trying to negociate with you for 5 months, for 5 months you’ve been trying to humiliate us

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.280
we tried our best, but now we cannot pay!

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.720
Because we’re left with nothing but skin and bones

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.200
and now you’re asking for our skin!’

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.900
If the Greeks had said that, the odds are that the EU would have backed down

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.920
Why? Because a Greek bankruptcy, means triggering the European insurance mechanisme,

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.720
i.e. the European Financial Stability mechanism

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.120
And when the insurance is triggered it is the Stability Mechanism that has to pay

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.640
Which means that if Greece had gone bankrupt

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.280
France would have had to cough up 40 billion euros, and Germany 60 billion!

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.080
And guess what, no-one fancied paying that much

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.680
In short, if Alexis Tsipras hadn’t signed

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.880
he would have found himself in a situation of bankruptcy

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.640
and suddenly on the other side of the table they would have got very ‘realistic

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.360
They would have said

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.100
Right, so 80% of the Greek debt is from now on in public hands

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.060
in the hands of the European Central Bank

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.160
and in the hands of the European Financial Stability mechanism

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.320
which means what?

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.280
Paper! Just paper, my friends and comrades!

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.340
and upon taking the sum of the debt to the European Central Bank

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.760
the ECB would have looked at it, said ‘how interesting’,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
and thrown it directly in the bin!

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.040
Because all those billions disappeared long ago

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.920
It’s just argumentations, that rely on power struggles

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.160
power struggles, comrades!

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.000
That’s why I raise my voice

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.360
He told you earlier!

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.200
Those who believe that currency is apolitical

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.400
that it’s not influenced by social and political relations

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.940
are dreamers! It’s not true!

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.760
That belief is designed to fool you.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.280
For example…

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.600
When you go to the bank, do you really think they lend you money they actually have?

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.480
(Because when you lend to a neighbour, you lend your money)

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.660
But the bank that lends you money has never had a penny of it!

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.800
They wait until you’ve built the house or bought the car,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.040
so that behind the banknotes there is a tangible return.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.380
Maybe it’s a little complicated.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.200
But everyone must understand it!

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.120
You must become experts in the materialist theory of currency.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.080
You must understand it.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.180
Because when the battle begins for this country

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.080
it won’t only depend on one or two people

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.360
it will be depend on millions of people

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.540
that must be educated, prepared to resist,

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.960
because in order to resist, one must be morally strong

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.480
One must be informed, one must be knowledgeable

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.960
You must learn! You must read!

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.540
You must teach those who don’t know.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.840
And those who don’t know must ask those who do

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.320
until everyone knows!

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.920
Because that’s the way the fight can be fought by the people.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.440
Comrades, you’ve heard talk about the ‘Plan B’

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.080
But don’t let it make you skip a letter!

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.600
There’s the Plan B but there’s also the Plan A.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.240
The Plan A is the plan for sensible people

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.440
Me. And others in the room here.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.840
We arrive and we say:

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.840
Right, let’s look at the results.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.960
The policies you apply

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.680
we won’t go into an ideological debate, we know eachother:

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.520
we like sharing, you’re stingy and selfish, no point talking about it

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.520
let’s look at the results.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.040
Nothing works, there’s unemployment everywhere

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.940
The only result for which you are satisfied with yourselves is

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.860
“Germany exports cars and machine tools"

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.840
And you expect us to be happy about that and applaud you

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.940
But guess what? We don’t care!

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.960
What we want is to be able to live happily with the few simple things we ask for

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.280
education, social security,

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.000
look after our elderly, look after our children

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.720
have holiday leave… Simple things!

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.700
And we’re ok with sharing your billions

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.840
because we don’t have any billions to share.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.480
We’re ok with sharing your millions!

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.780
Because you are able to say

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.820
‘I’m getting 16 million euros to leave’, like the boss of Alcatel.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.020
Oh well, he merely ruined his company

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.720
He destroyed a jewel of the French industry sector

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.660
He leaves and gets 16 million.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.960
Everyone protests, so he says ‘ok ok, I’ll take only 8

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.160
8? But why 8?

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.260
And who’s the type of person that gives up half of his pay?

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:41.460
Nobody! Nobody normal who has earned his pay honestly gives up half of it!

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.300
So if he accepts to cut it by half,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.660
that means he knows himself that he hasn’t earned it honestly.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.000
Now getting back to what I was saying before.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.300
The Plan A is the sensible people’s plan

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.780
Let’s look at you results:

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.900
nothing works!

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.200
We have an alternative solution and it can start with us, the French

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.660
If we gain a majority we’ll say:

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.060
France has signed treaties

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.620
Please, comrades, it’s important that you treat politics as a very serious matter

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.560
France has signed treaties.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.280
She honours the treaties she has signed.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.280
And the other countries that have signed alongside us

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.840
we ask them to apply their contents.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:26.780
As a result, in order to come out of a treaty that we have democratically agreed to (through our elected deputies)

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.960
we need a mandate by the people.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.080
If we want to go back on the main aspects of the Budget Treaty

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.960
the only way to do it is to consult the French People.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.700
Just as Tsipras did with the Memorandum.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.040
The difference is that I propose a referendum not on a Memorandum

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.760
but a referendum concerning a certain number of European policies

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.880
And we’ll make sensible propositions

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.780
We’ll say to them, ‘Listen,

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.780
before the euro, before your ‘wonderful’ Budget Treaty,

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.860
before your ‘sublime’ economic policies, what were we doing?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.320
we were making Airbus (you enjoy talking about Airbus!)

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.960
except with the current regulations, we’d be unable to do Airbus!

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.320
Because Airbus received subsidies for several years.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.320
And what else were we making?

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.320
The Ariane space rocket!

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.320
You keep talking about that too

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.720
you like calling it ‘the European rocket’, because all the flags are printed on its fuselage!

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.800
Ah! You like talking about it!

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.120
Except with current regulations we’d be unable to do the Ariane rocket.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.900
Because the company that produced Ariane received subsidies

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.840
And today it represents 50 % of the global satellite market.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.740
You see, friends, what I’m trying to say

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.320
is that our approach to problems is not a purely ideological approach

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.400
(even though there’s ideological reasoning behind our actions.)

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.400
It’s a rational approach: their way doesn’t work.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.400
Fine. So we explain all that to them.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.400
All depends on who explains.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.280
There are people who are more or less credible when they raise their voice

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.600
Some have the heart of a sheep, and they don’t get very far

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.600
because you can hear them bleating miles away.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.160
And there are others

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.160
who are of a different calibre

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.500
ith this in mind, there are two possible attitudes:

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.000
France is the second largest territory

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.880
and the second largest population, and soon the largest population of Europe

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.560
Either enter into sensible discussions with France, or offend her!

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.780
I know perfectly well

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.380
That within the German government of Mrs Merkel of the CDU-CSU

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.400
a party that’s working on this very geopolitical idea

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.000
That if you push everyone too far

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.080
and in particular if you push the Eurozone

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:48.040
‘til it bursts, ejecting what they call the ‘club med’

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.120
The ‘club med’ supposedly refers to the Mediterranean countries.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.300
See how arrogant these little pretentious people are

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.600
calling it the ‘club med’.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.600
Who’s in this ‘club med’, I ask you?

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.840
France, second largest economy of the continent.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.160
Italy, third largest economy of the continent.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.280
Spain, fourth largest economy of the continent

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:16.140
In other words, the bureaucrats of Mrs Merkel’s CDU-CSU, call ‘club med’ their main competitors!

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.180
That’s the simple truth!

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.940
And they’ve got it into their heads that if they burst apart the Eurozone

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.700
they’d create a ‘Mark’zone (or whatever they’d call it)

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.340
with on one side slaves and servants

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:34.480
(who’d come from Eastern Europe, and especially from Ukraine; where workers would be paid 100 euros instead of 130 for a Chinese worker)

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.080
and with the pieces of this cheap labour mass which would then put together in Germany,

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.880
Germany would become an even stronger export power.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.120
This is what they’ve convinced themselves.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:55.320
They’ve convinced themselves so well of this plan, that they’re preparing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:01.240
which is designed as a free trade deal between the US and Europe

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.400
and some will obviously benefit more than others from this union,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.080
the large companies of the German chemical industry

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.080
the car manufacturers, tool-machine factories,

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.960
the intensive animal farming industry, and all the other horrors that poison Europe

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.760
So, I ask you to understand this

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.360
do not limit the debate to the question of the Euro.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.640
You must read up on geopolitics as well

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
That you consider all the different factors.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
It’s not easy, we know.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:37.040
You should look at all the factors to understand that the Euro is like the culminating point

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.720
the knot that ties together all the little strings that are the Budget Treaty

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.320
the Financial Stability Mechanism,

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.520
NATO and the alliance with the United States

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.640
the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.640
All those pieces make a whole.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.640
It’s not the euro that we have to come out of

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.160
it’s a straightjacket we must free ourselves from

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.160
and the zip of the straightjacket is the euro!

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.740
And to do that,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.600
Maybe some of you will be disappointed by what I’m about to say.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.600
Don’t hold it against me.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.520
It’s my responsibility, my duty, to ask myself:

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.520
if I were faced with this task, how would I go about it?

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.920
I can’t see myself tackling it like a university professor

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.920
might when he gives lectures

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.520
(which is, needless to say, an essential activity)

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.520
when he can present things that may remain abstract.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.160
It’s about leading a great population of 65 million peoplE

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.000
of whom the political involvement can change the History of Europe.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.400
If we, the French, decide to change our stand concerning the European Union

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.400
we must do it held by a great project

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.760
that will allow all the populations to come out at the bright end of the tunnel.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.400
Because our voice is powerful, and we have powerful means.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.400
Earlier, Yanis rightly said

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.620
we have to frighten them once and for all so that we can stop being frightened.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.420
We have ‘nuclear dissuasion’

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.060
Let me reassure you – no-one wants to press the button

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.160
But it’s useful for everyone to think we could.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.160
Because that’s the only way they’ll leave us alone

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.360
We must have the following attitude

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.320
we start with sensible proposals, the ones I explained a few minutes ago (plan A)

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.320
and if they refuse our sensible proposals

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.440
then we will show them that we the people will not accept to be anything other than free – that’s the plan B

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.920
And there are different positions on the plan B

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.700
and now’s the time to discuss them.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.140
This is a great moment, here at the Fête de l’Humanité

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.860
For the first time in so many months, in so many years

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.860
despite there being various organisations

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.960
of course, (and I’d like to congratulate them on the work they do

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.340
like the Party of the European Left, but there are figures missing from it)

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.660
and we hadn’t succeeded in getting ourselves organised.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.300
You know, it’s very hard to get organised once you’re in power.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.300
you can all imagine the difficulty

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.520
do you know why we can’t just pick up the phone and call eachother?

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.520
Because our phones are all tapped.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.640
I can’t just call up Varoufakis, Finance Minister, and say to him

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.640
“So, are you all set up? Planned and ready to do the Grexit?

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.640
Have you got the currency en bis? all ready?”

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.000
And he replies “Yup, no worries, we’ve got it all ready, there are X millions.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Of course we can’t

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
We can’t email eachother

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.080
So we’re using the old-fashioned but trusty method: carrier pigeons!

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.240
You see, we have to prepare ourselves through other means

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.240
It entails a psychological preparation,

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.380
to stand firm, to not give in, to not be afraid

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:30.700
to be filled with the feeling of strength that we embody

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.640
thanks to our size in number and our knowhow and expertise.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.640
we must be confident in our strength

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.640
we are not afraid of a People’s revolution!

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.780
We are not afraid to spark phenomena that can make changes all across Europe thanks to our own efforts

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.780
We must not be hesitant.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.320
We must go forward, forward, forward!

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.100
That’s the plan B: we never give in.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.100
Right!

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.660
Now you understand it all!

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.480
Today we’ve got together, we’ve talked

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.480
today is an important day for me

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.980
Politics stems from human encounters.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.740
Don’t believe those who tell you that politics is still like in olden days

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:18.800
when impersonal politicians would say

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.620
‘one thinks’ instead of ‘I think’, instead of ‘us’ they’d say ‘the party’

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.420
and we thought we were in the right back then and felt stronger for it,

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.040
but we all know now that with that kind of language

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.440
we end up not knowing who we’re talking to!

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.260
We lose sight of who’s in front of us

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.420
We just see a puppet, a number, a statistic.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.140
t’s important to talk with people who have experience in saying ‘no’.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.460
It’s very important that these two, and the other, Oskar Lafontaine.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.240
When the time came to leave the Socialist Party and found the Left Party,

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.320
with comrades (who had never been in the former) I visited Oskar Lafontaine several times.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.460
Not just to talk politics.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.460
But to talk man to man.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.460
what would happen?

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.100
what should I be prepared for?

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.760
what would I be made to go through?

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.100
how would I be treated?

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.160
and Oskar listed a number of unpleasant things that he said I should prepare myself for.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.740
and, listen to this, in my case it has always been the worst things that I’ve had to endure

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.740
To put it in other words, concerning the cruel treatment, they made sure I received my dose,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.740
and made sure it lasted a good long while.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.740
But I always felt strong

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.740
And you do too, I imagine?

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.480
And now even stronger, four years on

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.300
after bringing together 4 million people [in the last presidential elections]

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.180
around the fundamental values that we defend.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.300
And the People’s decision makes us feel strong.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:44.220
The other day I was reading the newspaper (which doesn’t happen very often because it’s a rather depressing affair)

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.140
I read Les Echos to keep informed of the opinions of the capitalists and business leaders

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.120
and I read L’Humanité to be sure to keep up to date with the various social battles within the country

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.400
With regards to the other newspapers, it depends.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.100
If I’m in a good mood, I read them all.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.700
If I’m feeling a little peaky, I don’t, because the bad vibes get too heavy.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.960
And I must say I don’t agree with the caricatures of me they publish

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.960
Firstly they always make me look fatter than I am!

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.540
And on a more serious note they often make ‘me’ say things I would never say

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.320
Anyway, a few jokes before reading a couple of lines never goes amiss

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:23.240
I said earlier that the root of the problem with this Europe is that it turned away from democracy and what the people want.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:28.440
All the examples I’ve demonstrated have consisted in putting one behind the other.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.580
The proof is that decisions are made without and against the people!

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:36.300
In French we call it the ‘Europe austéritaire’

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.440
this word is a mixture of ‘austerity’ and ‘totalitaire’ [totalitarian – in English it might be ‘Austeritarian Europe’]

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.580
Because this is what a totalitarian regime is: a regime that gets into your private lives,

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.680
decides that you won’t eat this, you’ll eat that, that you won’t go that way, you’ll go this way

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:55.320
Yes, the difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism is that step taken into people’s private lives.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.800
The system has got into your private lives to make you powerless.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.020
Right!

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.020
See the president you have

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.580
Here is a statement he made in a newspaper at a Press Dinner.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:12.600
He says: “The electorate votes, even when they don’t und erstand.”

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.780
It must be said you don’t really understand anything

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.780
they tell you to vote YES and you vote NO.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.580
“The electorate votes, even when they don’t understand.” says François Hollande.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.980
“And when they vote, we don’t always understand them.”!

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.560
So you vote ‘no’, he doesn’t understand, and takes it for a ‘yes’!

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.920
You vote for a renegotiation of the budgetary treaties

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.420
he understands ‘everything’s great with the budgetary treaties, no probs!’

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:45.480
Now, I will finish off by citing Zoe Konstantopoulo

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.400
she’s the president of the Greek parliament.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:41:02.600
Zoe, as Yanis, and all our Greek comrades, have straight faces with the occasional ironic expression

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.600
but they have lived through painful moments.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.580
Now they are here at the foot of a wall, a wall they would’ve preferred inexistent.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.840
A wall where comrades are caught off-guard

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.760
The one was signed even thought we had said we will not

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.880
One where we know that no lessons are to be given.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.880
and that, of course, one cannot say

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.320
that Syriza is now in power and they’re the same as the right,

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.320
of course they’re not and it would be stupid to claim they’re the same.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.540
But at the same time, it’s difficult to go much further with them,

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:41.000
because comrades from Popular Unity have built a resisting force, and we feel close to their resistance

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.780
Why? 
Because we are loyal to political programmes and not to people!

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.540
Because we believe in the ideas, and reject personality cults.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.900
Alexis Tsipras is our friend…but

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.680
but we are not his clients.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:02.360
We support Tsipras’s programme – the one for which he was elected

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:07.020
and the one for which the Greek people voted against the memorandum.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.380
Dear comrades, Zoe, just as the others, had to make a decision.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:17.080
You know that Syriza was at least as eruptive as the Left Front

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.120
Maybe a touch more, because there are only 9 parties in the Left Front

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.120
whereas there were 16 in Syriza.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.120
I don’t know how they managed!

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.120
(When I see how it is with nine!)

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.100
Sixteen, who end up creating one party.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.120
And then later, there’s the breakup. Popular Unity leave.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.240
Yanis says to them ‘well I understand you leaving, but

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:49.600
he doesn’t want to contribute to a fratricidal battle, he supports a programme.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.340
And here he is with us, to discuss the Plan B project.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:58.380
It’s a noble party, the Plan B party.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:04.200
And Zoe decides she’ll be candidate, she wanted to be here today.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.760
She will be candidate, she’s not a member of Popular Unity but she’ll stand with us.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.760
She’s the president of the Greek parliament.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.760
Comrades

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.760
They way she’s been treated despicable

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.200
Not only because she’s left-wing, but because she’s a woman!

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.740
And they lay it on thick!

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:31.640
Us men, they represent us as monstrous animals, with an untidy beard, mouth wide open, with claw-like hands, bloodshot eyes

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.640
Like they did with the great Jaurès, before me.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.980
And myself after him,
and a few others in between.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.500
But with women it’s worse!

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:45.760
They’re shown as beasts too, but they’re brutalised also through their sex.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.960
They’ve called Zoe a ‘sexually frustrated orangutan’ in the Greek press.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:58.160
There are timeslots on Television entitled ‘Zoe’s deliriums’

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.360
In which they always show the worst images of her

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.420
with her mouth wide open, with an angry expression

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.580
(angry just like any human being is when they are worn out by such a complicated situation as Greece’s

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:13.520
Well, Zoe does not ask you to shed any tears for her, nor express compassion.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.260
Zoe’s message is this, a one-sentence message, and it will conclude our meeting.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.240
Listen up out there! All of you! Keep Zoe’s oath

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.360
Everyone has the right, and the duty, to resist.
