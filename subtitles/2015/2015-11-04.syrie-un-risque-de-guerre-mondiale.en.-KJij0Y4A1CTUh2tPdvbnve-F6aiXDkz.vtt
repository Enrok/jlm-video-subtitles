00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
JLM: Speaking of Syria, let me point out that Al Qaeda

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.860
is apparently the ally of allies - because apparently, that's the way they are referred to -

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.520
that is, FranÃ§ois Hollande, Mr Obama and others.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.040
So Al Qaeda is their ally under the name of Al Nusra, but we fight them in Afghanistan.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.680
They're bad guys in Afghanistan, but they're good guys in Syria,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.320
and ISIS are the bad guys in Syria, but the good guys when they fight the Kurds.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.720
This situation is confused, and people are being put on. So what's going on there?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:40.380
All the great powers are involved in this situation, as well as the main financiers in the region, that is, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.120
This war is a very classic and conventional war that aims at destroying countries

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.420
that have always been a problem to the Gulf monarchies, Turkey and Iran.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.080
The strategy of France and the USA is clearly a flop,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.920
because ISIS, that was supposed to be contained in one place, is now somewhere else.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.500
Let me remind you that the last time we fought them, it was in Iraq, but they're now in Syria,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.380
although we were supposed to have attacked them on countless occasions.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.780
These people have a curious capacity to resist bombings,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.980
and now, they're in Syria, and we're putting on the same act again, and it doesn't have any effect.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.520
The Russians are there too now to strike ISIS - and they're doing quite well -, and barely did they arrive

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.440
that they were criticized for bombing opponents and civilians.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.980
Journalist: That's what an NGO said.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.060
JLM: Do we have to believe it just because it's an NGO? Journalist: Well, why not?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.020
JLM: Why not, you're right? But why would you not believe me?

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.140
Believe me, my information about the situation is at least as good as that of this NGO.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.760
What should we say? That they bomb civilians? Of course they do!

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.860
Have you ever seen a war in which civilians are not killed by bombings? It doesn't exist!

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.880
The bombings by the well-intentioned belligerants in Yemen prove it.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.600
As you know, these belligerants did good to the 40,000 people they killed.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.860
Well they bomb weddings. In Afghanistan, we bomb hospitals.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.120
But not in Yemen, because they're the "good guys", so we don't talk about it. We'll talk about those who... (inaudible)

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.280
Journalist: According to the NGO you disagree with, Russia mainly bombs the rebels we praised 4 years ago when they rose against the regime.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.380
JLM: Well I did not. I never praised them, so I don't see why...

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.920
Journalist: Don't you think there's such a thing as moderate opposition to Bashar Al Assad?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.860
JLM: Of course not! Have you ever seen moderate Islamists except in your newspapers? It doesn't exist! On the field they're as savage as the rest!

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.400
Journalist: No, no! Many western leaders say there is a moderate opposition.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.100
JLM: Yeah, yeah, depending on their whims! I just told you that the moderates were Al Qaeda,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.000
although we said they were terrorists less than two months ago, and we are bombing them in Afghanistan. This is a joke!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.300
Why am I so passionate about this issue? After all, I could wash my hands of it!

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.340
But this war could spread to the rest of the world, there's a risk of a global war!

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.160
The British speak of bombing the Russian planes that supposedly violate an airspace. This is crazy!

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.720
We should not do that! We should come to the table and talk with those who are involved in the war.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.460
Journalist: Does this also include Bashar Al Assad?

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.280
Other journalist: Bashar Al Assad, who is responsible for slaughtering his people, I just say it in passing...

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.140
JLM: Yes of course! We are now going to repeat this in unison with the people behind the camera...

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.620
Journalist: It's a fact...

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.780
JLM: But the question you should ask me is "Should we negotiate with ISIS?" It doesn't seem to bother you.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.880
I just said we should negotiate with those who are involved in the war, and the first person you think of is Bashar Al Assad.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.160
So to you, ISIS is not the enemy.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.820
To you all, our main enemy is Bashar Al Assad, and you don't even know why.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.280
You think our main objective is to bring down Al Assad's government, whatever the cost,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.580
well I disagree with bringing down his regime at any cost.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.400
I think he should go, and that there should be a national unity government.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.420
But he should go only if the circumstances allow an honest agreement.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.020
because otherwise, Syria will turn into a new version of Lybia. Is that what you want?

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.340
Journalist: We understood your point. JLM I hope you did...

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.700
The solution to this type of situation is rarely a military one, everyone knows this.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.820
If that was the case, there would be joy and hapiness in Lybia, Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.980
In these countries, we defended "great, interesting and intelligent causes",

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.920
and it resulted in absolute chaos, atrocious sufferings

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.160
and the massive immigration of poor people who flee a situation that no one no longer controls.
