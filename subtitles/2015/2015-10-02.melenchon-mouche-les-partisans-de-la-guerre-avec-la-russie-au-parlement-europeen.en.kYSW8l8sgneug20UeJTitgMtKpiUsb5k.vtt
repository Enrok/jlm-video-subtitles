00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Chairman (Elmar Brok): Mr "Président" Mélenchon.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.380
JLM: Thank you.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.560
Thank you dear Mr Chairman.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.600
With all due respect dear Mr Brok, I disagree with your introduction completely.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.300
I would like to thank Mr Pushkov for being here and reassure him that the European public opinion

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.680
is not as enthusiastic as some people in this room.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.960
In France, my country, many are the political leaders - even the Prime Minister said it yesterday -

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.180
who think that the anti-Russian hysteria leads us Europeans nowhere.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.760
No one will make war on Russia except lunatics,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.040
and no one will intervene militarily amid nuclear power plants in Ukraine.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.800
This idea is absurd, and we all know that it will not happen.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.620
The exaggerations we just witnessed are a waste of time.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.620
I personally don't think you are the agressors,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.320
and the fact that not a word was said about the intervention of the USA in Ukraine

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.960
shows that there is a Cold War atmophere in this room that corresponds to nothing in the real world.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.900
Anyway, they're just talking.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.560
Last weekend, Angela Merkel and François Hollande met Vladimir Putin to discuss the agreement.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.540
I would like to know what were the measures adopted by your Parliament

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:26.020
in order to guarantee that Russia fulfill the agreement that is apparently well advanced since last weekend.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:37.520
Mr Brok, I would like to add that Europeans will always be grateful to Russia for liberating our countries during WWII.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.860
No one will ever forget the 20 million Russians who died for our freedom.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.020
Someone in the audience: Ukrainians died too!

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.140
(inaudible)

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:58.900
Chairman (Elmar Brok): Mr Mélenchon, the USA and England also took part in the liberation of France.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.860
Those you just criticized were there and had a responsibility, don't forget that.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.520
Let me remind you who was there during the Normandy Landings.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.600
JLM: (inaudible)

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.380
Chairman: Your speaking time is over Mr Mélenchon.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.380
JLM: Yours too then!
