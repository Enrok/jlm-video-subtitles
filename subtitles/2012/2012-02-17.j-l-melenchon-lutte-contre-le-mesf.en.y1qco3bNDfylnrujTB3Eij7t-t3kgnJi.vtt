00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.480
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the presidential
candidate for Front de Gauche!

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.200
(Applause)
(Hear! Hear! )

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.800
Dear friends, I guess everybody
knows why we’re here today.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.320
Of course it will not be said that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.840
when one of the peoples of Europe
is suffering under the blows of capitalism,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.280
we, who are progressive
and sincere Europeans,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.160
strong supporters of a social Europe,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.200
of brotherhood
and the union of free peoples,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.000
we’d remain snugly at home,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.400
while people are suffering and fighting

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.520
for the bare minimum
that will allow them a decent life.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.160
But listen to me carefully,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.520
it’s not enough
for us to show solidarity.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.880
You have to know one thing: this plan

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.680
that is now being applied to Greece,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.080
should our country
run into the same kind of trouble,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.920
would be applied exactly
in the same way to our country.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.920
And this is about to be decided
by the National Assembly

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.360
on this coming 21st February.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.400
Do you hear this?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.640
On 21st February
the French National Assembly

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.720
will vote on the European Financial
Stability Mechanism

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.440
which, if approved,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.160
will lead first to our own submission

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.840
to the vindictive and cruel troika
of the European Central Bank,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.080
the IMF and the European Commission,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.240
should the country come to that point,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.600
and secondly,
if this is passed on 21st February,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.480
then the last article of that
European Stability Mechanism

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.320
would put into gear
the approval procedure

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.800
for the next European treaty
to be signed in March.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.840
Spread the news around!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The outcome of this is being acted
in this country on 21st February.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.560
Put a question to your MPs!

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.120
Check whether or not they will be present
on the day of the vote,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.800
because right-wing MPs
and those of the Socialist party

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.240
have refused a public ballot
where everyone would vote on roll call.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.720
So it’s your job to check that your MPs

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.800
will be present on that day
and to know how they will vote.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.880
The best way of showing solidarity
with the people of Greece,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.800
is to reject here in Paris
the European Stability Mechanism

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.440
and to impose a referendum
on the next treaty

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.400
that will be submitted
to the Assemblies’ vote.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.440
Thank you all.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.920
Let’s remain watchful, mobilized and
in full support of the people of Greece!

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.000
Hear! Hear!

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.680
Resistance! Resistance!
