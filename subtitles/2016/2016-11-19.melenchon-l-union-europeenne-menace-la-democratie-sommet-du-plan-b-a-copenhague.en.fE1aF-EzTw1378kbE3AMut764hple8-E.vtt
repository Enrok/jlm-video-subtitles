00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
The Sao Paolo Forum was opposed to the free-trade treaties that the USA tried to impose on Latin America.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.860
The Plan B Summit is the european equivalent of the Sao Paolo Forum.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.700
Ladies and gentlemen, the participants of the Sao Paolo Forum were looked down on at the time

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.560
and sneered at haughtily.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.300
Well in that forum were those who would later become the members of ten governments in Latin America,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.840
just as the members of ten future european governments are in that room right now.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.040
Fortunately, the only missing members of our summit are precisely those who are on the verge of forming a government.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.320
This is a symbol of the age we are living in.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.400
The greatest hopes are within our reach while the greatest threats are emerging.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.860
We the people of Europe are united, maybe more than other peoples anywhere in the world.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:06.980
We are united because we went through a period, I would even say two periods, the two World Wars,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.440
when capitalism collapsed because of its own contradictions,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.520
not because the peoples wanted it.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.660
I constantly wear the red triangle, not only because it's the color of my hopes,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.060
but it is also the colour of the symbol that the political deportees wore under the Nazi occupation.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.860
We more than any other know the price to pay when we lose.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:42.000
United by the past, we are also bound by the present everyday, because we look at each other.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.680
And when elections take place in a country, we look at the result of the party whose ideas are closest to our own.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.100
We don't need to organize meetings to know which party we prefer.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.340
We know this because we inform ourselves and because we follow the development

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.040
of the reorganization of the european peoples,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.920
and we're all frightened that the far right is rising.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.220
There is no excuse for this. We know what is happening and where the phenomenon comes from.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.820
It comes from the fact that the right is becoming more radical.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.700
There has always been a popular right, and it is turning into the far right

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.180
under the direction of a division of financial capital that benefits from this situation

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.520
because its opponents are not the damage of the crisis. We are.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.120
We represent a social and political alternative, a social alternative in particular.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.660
We are the only alternative to the global plundering capitalism is carrying out.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.100
We are also bound by the future.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.820
We know that we are closely interdependent in coping with the threat to the peoples of Europe

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.500
that the use of nuclear power in a lot of countries represents,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.360
particularly in a country that is carrying out a war like Ukraine,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.720
where seven of the oldest nuclear power plants in the world stand, like the sarcophagus of Tchernobyl.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.980
We know that we are all confronted with a process of self-collapsing of the organized institution

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.360
that we call the European Union and its treaties.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.240
The Brexit is the first indication of this self-collapsing process as is Donald Trump's election on a global scale.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.660
The other indication of this process is of course the rise of the far right.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.280
If the far right is a threat to democracy and social democracy

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.600
we must keep in mind that the first threat to democracy is the EU.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.980
It is the EU that bullied Cyprus, Greece and Ireland,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.760
it is the EU that threatens to bully Spain, Portugal, and even my country.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.980
Therefore, our task today is to put an end to this threat to freedom.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:12.120
We are not just comparing abstract, noble ideas in a scholarly conference

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.700
we are acting against a real threat to our civilization's most essential social and democratic benefits.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:33.640
In 2017 and 2018, it is not through the outcome of a conference, nor even through one of us's wickedness

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.200
that problems will emerge. These problems will emerge because they are bound to emerge.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.260
By the year 2017, all the european peoples must know whether they want the TAFTA treaty or not,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.820
or the TTIP... The name of this treaty with the USA changes every year.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.000
Or the CETA treaty with Canada.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.900
In 2017, we must decide what to do with these treaties, otherwise they will decide!

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.040
'They' being the rich and powerful; and Juncker, the head of the hooligans,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.720
who was the organizor of the fiscal plundering of all the european countries for many years;

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.720
or Angela Merkel, the boss of the european capitalist economy, who accumulated a lot of surplus every year,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.560
which should lead her to be punished more severley than Greece was

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.180
because she accumulated this surplus at the expense of all the european countries.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.000
We are going to face this geopolitical reality.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.260
I would like to emphasize what I just said: in 2017 the five european presidents

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.340
decided that a new treaty would apply to Europe.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.360
I hope you are all aware that this decision was taken in the month of June 2015

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.000
and if you are aware of this, help me inform FranÃ§ois Hollande about this.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.820
When I met him after the Brexit, he asked my opinion on this matter.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.560
I first told him that Great-Britain should not be punished for this, and I added that

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:13.580
the new treaty should absolutely stop devastating Europe on a social, monetary and fiscal level.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.460
He said: "What treaty?".

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.840
I answered "The new treaty that was decided upon in 2015 and that will be implemented in 2017".

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.780
Do you know what he said then?

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:31.240
"No one told us about that" was his answer, although this treaty will be implemented.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.000
The peoples of Europe must become aware that this work has begun and that an official report will be published.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.860
Consequently, the Plan B Summit will be useful to us, in Paris, Rome or Copenhagen.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.360
It will enable us to join our forces in order to face the upcoming events.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.780
There is also another upcoming event no one seems to be willing to talk about.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:02.340
Do you know what is their response to the dismantling of the world and to Brexit,

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.540
and what is their idea for punishing the people of Europe?

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.420
Do you think they want to build an atmosphere of enthusiasm by creating new social benefits?

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:16.120
Do they finally want to put an end to the articles of the european treaties that forbid tax harmonization

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.540
and that organize the unfair competition between the workers of our countries? No they don't!

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:27.140
Their response is the Europe of Defence! This is the idea they came up with!

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:35.340
We would jump for joy in joining or forces to invade other countries somewhere in the world!

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:41.960
It is on this idea that they wanted to start building Europe in 1954.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.080
No one should forget this! Previous to the Treaty of Rome, the first attempt to build the EU

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.300
was the project of a European Defence Community.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.940
The idea was to prepare Europe to resist against or to attack USSR,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.000
and today, they are laying the foundations for the Europe of Defence project.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.100
Let me tell you that if I became the President of France, France will not participate in the Europe of Defence project,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.520
and we will leave NATO's integrated command structure!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.440
We will refuse the logic of a european defence structure because this logic leads to war.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.860
We'd rather that every country be able to defend itself and cooperate with other countries

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:32.360
rather than a new war power emerge, because we know that if it has weapons, it will use them.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.880
History showed that those who arm themselves always use their weapons.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.120
Arming oneself has never led to peace, it has always led to war.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.380
We are in favour of a policy of deterrence.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:50.660
Dear friends, for now we are developing the idea of a Plan B, but we can't afford to have only one.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:58.720
We want to develop several Plan Bs, technical and of course political solutions. Why?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.180
Because we must prepare to govern our countries.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:10.700
Governing is our future, because we believe that the revolution that will sweep over Europe will be a democratic revolution.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.700
Here is what I want to say.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.580
Either we try to cooperate in order to change the EU,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:26.040
this is our Plan A, which consists in stopping free trade,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:36.540
in developing cooperative protectionism, in enabling social and fiscal harmonization in Europe...

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.180
Either we try to change Europe together

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:52.080
or those of us who refuse the clash of civilizations organized by the EU will have to leave it together.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.520
This is what I hope as I am speaking to you

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:02.040
In a few months, my country will make a choice that cannot be predicted.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:10.580
The polls say that I am in the lead of all the leftwing political organizations.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.260
I know that I carry a great responsibility on my shoulders,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:18.620
but I'd like to add that this responsibility is not only on my shoulders, but also on yours,

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.980
because if I am elected next year, I'll call for your help and I know you'll be there.
