00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
We cannot keep on following the USA's war tank.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.800
We have nothing to do within NATO.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.140
We do not agree with the setting up of military bases in Poland, Lithuania,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.400
or elsewhere to wage war on Russia.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.980
France is not a "Western nation"

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.680
in the way that the USA defines "the West",

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.100
which includes some "Western countries" as unconvincing as Japan.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.180
We are a universalist nation, present on all five continents.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.060
Our largest border is the border with Brazil, not Germany.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.260
Therefore, France should be the fulcrum of a new altermundialist world alliance,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.120
with the aim of respecting the sovereignty of each people,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.160
and applying the conventions and standards of the ILO and the UN.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.920
They are the only references of international law preliminary to the use of force,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.220
whereas today, force is being used before diplomacy.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.460
We should stick to this political principle.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.500
France can do it.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
We are members of the Security Council and we are present on all five continents.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.050
We have the capacity to do this.
