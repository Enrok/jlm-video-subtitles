00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
Since 2001 and the Clearstream-gate, there has been a scandal every year

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.600
concerning tax evasion and tax trafficking.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.660
The truth is that tax evasion is written in the genetic code of the European Union,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.380
that facilitates tax trafficking.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.540
Article163 forbids tax harmonization, which amounts to encouraging the lowest bid.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.560
Article 63 facilitates all the transactions and forbids a limit to the transactions between countries.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.760
The fact that this system is legal is the reason why you succeeded in electing

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.320
the person that is responsible for these scandals as President of the European Commission.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280
And after two sessions of the parliamentary commission, you still haven't found anything.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.260
But on April 26th, the two whistleblowers that revealed this scandal will be judged.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.520
They face 10 years' imprisonment and 1M euros fine.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.700
In these conditions, the Luxleaks-gate repeats itself with the Panama Papers.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.580
The French bank Société Générale was under ECB control

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660
while it was opening offshore companies.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.040
The head of the company committed perjury before French Members of Parliament,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.300
but I'm the one who is prosecuted for defamation!

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.960
Since your plans are useless, the only you have one thing to do

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
is to protect whistleblowers. They are severely punished because they did us a service.
