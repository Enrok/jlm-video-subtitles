00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.860
Legalization of cannabis, Lord Nagalfar.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.980
Lord, nothing less!

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.740
Given the results in other countries that have already taken the plunge, what do you think of the legalization of cannabis in all its aspects?

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.260
Yes, you mean not only medicine but also ...

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.980
To smoke it, is that what you mean?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.460
Lord Nagalfar ... Is that what you mean, get some courage!

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.380
And the question is ... Z, K, Y,...  
I think it will be Mokritzky!

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.180
"A question many are asking" ... Not sure!
 "Legalisation or not? And why ?" OK !

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.860
"Hello and thank you. Can the legalization of cannabis be good economically and socially for France?" In fact...

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.180
I'll start here! I plug in whether it is good economically or socially.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.580
What is important is to see how we solve the health problem of smoking cannabis.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.040
So you see I am not in favor of cannabis, but I favor legalizing cannabis...

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040
because I am not in favor of cannabis.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.660
That's the first thing.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.700
Because if a product is prohibited, you can not campaign against!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.840
That makes sense. You see all kind of horrific campaigns on tobacco

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.700
but you never have a single one saying : "Dude, if you abuse with cannabis,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.700
uh blah blah blah, it will destroy you."  
Because that's the problem about smoking it.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.080
I'm not talking about the use of cannabis for other purposes, therapeutic, psychological, etc.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.600
I want to be able to campaign against the use of cannabis, so we should first legalize it.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.220
That's all, if you want to do prevention campaigns, then it needs to be legalized.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.920
If you don't want it, if you're OK with the wonderful situation that we all know...

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.100
... for a single bar of hasch, people need to hide in all possible ways,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.520
if you get stuck and you unfortunately have a piece of bar...

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.020
then it's the end of the world, you go directly to the cells!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.420
If, in addition, we found you with a brush, trying to paste a poster...

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.040
or writing something nasty on the wall, well... you recieve twice!

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.060
Because you are deemed suspicious! 
And now, more serious...

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.880
this trade is the basis of absolutely incredible traffic...

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.000
wich consume so much time of police action

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.020
so much time for judges - wich would be better used for better purposes...

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:38.460
That's why you gonna be satisfied  - if that is your goal and your concern -

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.120
and then disappoint you. Because I am absolutely against cannabis, I am in favor of legalizing it.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.740
And not tell me it is hypocritical! 
Because what is hypocritical

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.880
is to say "it is forbidden" while everybody knows that everybody smokes, eh?

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.560
From all sides, everywhere, and there is no mean to stop it.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.580
Many people will say that I'm hypocritical because I want to fight it by legalizing it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.180
but nobody will say what hypocrisy it is when you live on the second floor

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.260
and you see the traffic being just down your window, what are you doing, do you call the police?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.900
No no no, and even sometimes you'll do your shopping!

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.620
So, enough with this hypocrisy, we have lost enough time, enough money

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.960
and done enough damage on people. 
Now we have to get serious.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.000
Well, I hope that this response will be talked about!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.320
To be honest with you, it took me a lot of time to convince myself...

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.240
Because ... In my mind, at first, legalizing meant supporting.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.620
But some friends advised me and conviced that it was unsane to think like that.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.140
Now I know that the insanity is to maintain the statu quo!

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.680
I've read plenty of articles on the subjects and discovered viewpoints, not only from France

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.120
but also international studies and discovered experiences from other countries

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.480
and that's it, I was convinced! Of course I am ready to hear opposite views, but as we asked mine, I've gave it!
