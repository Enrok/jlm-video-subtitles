00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.740
Like you, dear fellow, I think that the French and German progressives have a great historical responsibility.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:19.900
We are not merely confronting academic scenarios.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.020
We are living a very dangerous moment.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:32.600
And my presence here today by my Die Linke fellows' side aims at showing the danger we are facing.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.320
The EU has entered a dislocation process,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.380
and the worse aspects of this process are flowing out.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.460
This is the situation we are facing now.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.700
This is the situation we must confront.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.420
We are deeply attached to the european ideal of peace and concord.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.720
But this Europe has been methodically organized by the German right wing

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.400
as a machine that shocks the people of the EU with one another, compete with one another.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.900
We must stop this crazy logic.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.900
We have a responsibility, and you Germans as well.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.380
Clearly, Mrs Merkel's government would like Europe to believe that you Germans are living heaven on earth.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.800
In France, we are told that we should do the same as Germans.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:40.040
Well, I'm ready to do this, but my german model is Oskar Lafontaine, not Mrs Merkel.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.520
We do not want Mrs Merkel's model to become widespread to the rest of Europe.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.720
Now, let me tell you what our objectives are.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.700
We, the progressives, are ready to change Europe's organization deeply.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.120
We reach out everyday to make this transformation possible.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.880
However, if this transformation is not possible,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.500
we will prefer the sovereignty of our people and the refusal of the destruction of our industry and of our homeland,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.700
to this sort of nightmare that Mrs Merkel's Europe has become.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.520
I want to make this clear for everyone.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.800
Europe is a great idea, and it deserves better than becoming distorted as it is by Mrs Merkel and Mr SchÃ¤uble.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.920
We refuse the brutality of the treatment of Ireland, Cyprus or Greece

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.980
I warn everyone that we will not let this happen.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.640
This is why we are coming closer so vigorously to our fellows, with our progressive comrades, brothers and sisters.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.600
We very well know that the responsibility lies with Mrs Merkel's government, not with the German people.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.040
We know this. We have a lot of work to do, and that's what we came for today.
