00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.020
This week, there's been a news that I believe is terrible, I'm sure that

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.640
a lot of people listening to me have the same thoughts about it.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:16.840
It's that report, which says that half of vertebrates living species have been extinct in less than 40 years.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.429
Which means, that we have very clear symptoms, very strong alerts about the fact we're

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:29.460
in a major phase of major living species extinction.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.240
It is important to read the report summary to realize it.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.020
What is causing that great extinction ?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.100
The same thing that induce epidemic waves, cancers

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.640
and diseases of all kinds.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.420
The cycle of water is entirely disturbed.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.320
The majority of living species lost is in freshwater.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.440
The very base of the cycle of water.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.700
And why, what is happening ? What is the cause of this ? First, agriculture,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.610
to be more precise : the current agricultural model

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.689
If we don't change our alimentation, and in particular, if we don't eliminate

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.509
meat proteins, we are doomed  to destroy everything around us.

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.040
Destroy everything ! That's the main issue.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.750
It's not that I say it in Gala [French magazine]

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.940
Neither that, as people tell me "You're trying to take the market share of ecologists"

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.660
But, of course everyone must be ecologist ! And the market share

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.319
of ecologists, I'd rather tell you that it's not much, it's not today's topic.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.179
Everyone must become ecologist, which means understanding the importance of this question.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.979
It hasn't become a random question in the program, it must be a key question.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.779
If we do not act, the whole ecosystem is going to be destroyed !

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.280
Do you understand that, guys ? It's going to be destroyed, right in front of you in the upcoming years.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.170
It would be so easy to evade.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.540
I'm going to sweep an argument, because I've been annoyed by it.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.960
I was told "Yeah, you say that, but what do we do with the fact that meadows

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:58.020
-and I agree- that are meant for farming animals, are a very big part of agricultural lands."

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.520
Well, perfect ! I never said that we should stop eating meat, if we could we would.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:08.340
I'm just saying that we must do it another way and that we must stop producing

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.039
such quantities, with so poor quality.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.209
Because the mass of the meat that is flowing, is not the meat

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.810
of quality farming, it's the meat we take from the miserable beast that we

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.410
previously over-exploited in 1000-cows farms.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.770
All these wretched creatures that have been mistreated, as we all know,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.349
when they arrive at the end of the cycle, their meat is sold.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.209
The whole chain of production needs to be changed.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.120
Neither you or I asked for such animal farming.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.280
We never asked that, we never asked for antibiotics stuffed milk.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.610
We never asked for animals to be mistreated that way.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.500
So we have the right, as citizens, to say that we want another agriculture.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.120
We have even more right to say that we must realize the catastrophe we're

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.120
running into because of that kind of methods.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.180
To finish that, I've been interested in reading the end of the report : at

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.010
the end, I read something that is pure Melanchonism if I believe

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.040
those that mocked me.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.829
Here's what Arnaud Gauffier, who is the man in charge of agriculture

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.010
at the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) : " If everyone reduced by one half-portion

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.120
per day his meat consumption -don't tell me that not everyone eats meat

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.219
I know it-, while increasing his legume and cereals consumption

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.979
-and here comes the importance of expending crop food agriculture-

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.439
We could lower by 25%  greenhouse gas emissions linked to food.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:39.000
Understood ? So what we are explaining in the "Avenir en commun" (rough translation :Common future) program, and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.260
the little booklet about ecologic and peasant agriculture, that you're going to see;

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.959
these are not, like we hear saying in a contemptuous way,  a bobo delirium.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.390
These are questions that are linked to the survival of humanity and that allow us

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.799
to start an economical and ecologically productive logic

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.989
responsible, that creates jobs and lowers nature predation.

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.620
What better could we ask ? What would be better than that ? [rethorical]

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.560
Something that ask for care, work, and that produces a quality food.
