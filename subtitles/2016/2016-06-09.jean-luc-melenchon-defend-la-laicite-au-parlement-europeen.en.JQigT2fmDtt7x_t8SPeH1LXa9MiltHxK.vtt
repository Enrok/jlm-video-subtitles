00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.860
The draft legislation on creed and religion
that is currently being negociated by Parliament

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.400
is a threat for Catholics as well as all the other existing religions in Vietnam.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.000
By avoiding to acknowledge 
the legal existence of religious organizations,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.280
this law stands in direct contradiction
with the religious freedom

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.120
ensured by the Vietnamese Constitution.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.400
The authorities are therefore disrespecting
this fundamental law

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.200
and I invite Mr Mélenchon, 
who is a friend of all communists

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.580
to make a call to Vietnam in order to tell them 
they are disrespecting the Constitution

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.420
This is extremely serious, Mr Mélenchon

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.700
My dear colleague, I will always agree with you
when it comes to defending freedom

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.280
especially freedom of conscience,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.260
including, of course, religious freedom, since this idea,
called secularism, was born in my homeland

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.560
Now, Sir, this is my turn to ask you 
whether you would say the same

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.280
concerning religious freedom in Qatar, Saudi Arabia or Bahrain

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.160
and the other countries that we never hear about here,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.060
whereas it only takes one communist or leftist minister

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.600
for us to hear for hours about outcries of all sorts.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.280
Some are indeed relevant, but others are not
if it weren't for propaganda efforts.
