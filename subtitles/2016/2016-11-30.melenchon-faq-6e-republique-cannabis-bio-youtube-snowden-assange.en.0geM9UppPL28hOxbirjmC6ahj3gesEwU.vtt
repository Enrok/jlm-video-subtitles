00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.560
OK, so, as you know, I recently agreed to do a FAQ video,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.000
which means I answer some questions of Internet users.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.360
So, I don't know if it's such a good idea because we received more than 3000 questions

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.920
and... it wasn't a lot of fun for Antoine who had to sort them.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.420
He put them in order and tried to link them to the appropriate documents,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.180
because we have a document that we open whenever you ask a precise question,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.080
it is "L'Avenir en commun" ("Common future"), our program, and later on, I will show you some booklets.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.180
So we looked for answers in the book ... We have to prepare this, don't we?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.580
I took the questions on top of the stack, OK? It's the only criterion, and now I'll try to answer your questions.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.720
I'll try to be quick, otherwise we'll be there forever and a day,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.860
and as you know, I like to explain things in details, but it's not a good idea for this kind of exercise.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.860
So... Depending on your reactions, I'll see what I'll need to improve,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.060
but I must say it's quite extraordinary to receive 3000 questions.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.920
It enables us to have a dialogue that is maybe more interesting than more formal discussions.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.300
So thank you for giving me this idea, really, because it is a thought-provoking exercise for my work.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.320
OK, let's begin!

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.440
So Martin asks:

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.460
"You said on many occasions that one of your first measures would be to establish a constituent assembly.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.900
How do you intend to initiate and organize this process?"

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.160
So... First, it's in the program, and we consider that if people elect me, it means that they agree with this idea.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.640
And to me, this is a key idea because... It's important to understand that... What is it that makes a people?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.180
It's the fact that people decide laws together and obey the laws even when they don't agree with them.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.340
When I disagree with laws that I dont like, well I still disagree with them, but I obey them.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.120
So I struggle for their repeal, for modifications, and sometimes, I try to convince people not to vote for them,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.840
but I accept to obey them.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.000
So the rules of the game are very important, because they have a direct consequence:

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.020
you relinquish your freedom, which means you give up the possibility of doing what you want,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.580
because you decide to obey the law.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.800
So... You could argue that when you don't obey the law, you are punished.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.480
OK, but obeying the law is also a personal principle.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.860
There are other rules you disagree with which you obey. 
So it is crucial.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.880
This was my first point. Now my second point is that a people builds itself... It becomes a people.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.700
It's not only because we have borders that we are French!

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.620
We are French even beyond our borders, right? So what could it be?

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.060
I already said it a hundred times! It is not a skin color, it is not a religion,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.780
because there are all the religions and skin colors in this country,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.860
etc etc. It's not even the french language, because it is an official language in 29 countries or so.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.280
It's really the law that we have in common 
and the rules that frame the making of laws that define us as a people.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.340
So the constituent assembly is the assembly that is convened to decide the rules of the game,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.700
and the rules of the game, it's the constitution. It organizes public authorities, guarantees civil liberties, etc etc.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.080
So it is a key aspect to me. Besides, it is the core of my revolutionary strategy.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.540
How should we proceed to transform society radically?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.720
There are several ways to do this. For instance, you could decide to use clubs and rifles to do this,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.080
or you could establish a dictatorship.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.240
But there's another method: voting, and getting citizens involved.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.980
But that's not the easiest part! How long do you think people will stay involved?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.160
"One day, two days, maybe three days, and then what? Not every day!"

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.940
Well in a way, yes. We need to stay on the lookout, we need to stay well-informed.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.680
People are ready to do that. It's not the case anymore, but in the past,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.880
everybody watched the news on TV to get information. When there was a good documentary on TV, everyone watched it.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.520
Now people pick up information here and there, but they do it wisely

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.500
They try to find documentation, to form an opinion on such and such issue.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:08.280
You see, there is an opportuny to act on public matters on the long term.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.360
To put it simply, the constitution has to create the people.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.840
You might say "Well the French people already exist!" Tatata! Don't be so sure!

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.100
Of course they do, everyone has an ID, and we're French.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.100
But feeling that we are bound by a common future is not the same, we have to build this!

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.160
We need this moment when we bind together as a people.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.720
We need to write a new constitution in order to define our relations toward one another and the rights we have.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.420
I already witnessed experiences of constituent assemblies in Latin America.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.160
They really were impressive because there were real debates.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.460
In Ecuador, they even changed the place of the assembly.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.220
Instead of setting the assembly in Quito, the equivalent of Paris, they chose another city.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.840
People went there. There were processions to present the demands of the people to the deputies of the constituent assembly,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.240
An office gathered these demands and tried to turn them into articles of the constitution,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240
then people discussed them and voted.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.400
Also, when Venezuela changed its constitution, authorities printed articles of the constitution on rice and pasta bags

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.120
in order to get people involved and have them discuss the articles at home. Isn't it a good idea?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.240
And all this had the effect of getting people involved and making them think.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.960
As for us, the current constitution of 1958 changed a lot,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.720
it really comes from another era! I mean... it was 1958!

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.960
It was the end of colonial wars and... France was a very rural country.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.340
Now France is a completely urban country, and thankfully, colonial wars are over.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.980
We are involved in military interventions, but not in conflicts

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.000
that involve the whole population as before.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.440
And above all, the population is much younger, much more mixed culturally, much more educated...

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.620
Because the school system is often criticized, and some people really think that it's not worth a dime

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.720
and that the French are just a bunch of illiterate and ignorant people, but that's not true!

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.500
The education level is way higher everywhere,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:13.140
and waves of immigration transformed the French people, so much so that it is now a new people.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.000
It's a quick process, you know?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.760
For instance, few of my grandparents were French, but you can see that I am a fervent patriot.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.260
I'm saying all this to explain that a people writes a constitution in order to build itself.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.340
So how does a constituent assembly work? First, it's in the program, it's the first measure, so you can't miss it.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.580
If I become President, I'll use Article 11 of the current constitution

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.080
in order to initiate a referendum on the establishment of a constituent assembly.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.800
That's the first part. Then once the French people voted yes, we'll establish the assembly.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.860
It is not the same as the National Assembly, it is a different assembly,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.780
and there will be rules to choose the deputies of this assembly.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.340
First, you will not be able to become a member of the constituent assembly if you have already been a member of a previous assembly.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.560
Why is that? Not because I want to accuse those who have already been elected.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.680
We just want a fresh look on the future constitution, with people who never got involved in public affairs,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.780
people who think. They will have their own background of course, but it will be new for them,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.940
they'll examine the situation and say: "Well here's what we should do in a normal country",

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.120
and not: "Well, that's the way I was elected the last time".

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.760
OK, so you understood what I said.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.460
So one part of the assembly has to be elected, and I propose to draw lots to choose the rest of the assembly.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.260
This leads me to another question. Someone asked:

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.040
So his pseudonym is "That's so nuclear"...

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.240
I just can't get used to these pseudonyms... Anyway!

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.000
So "That's so nuclear", "@slowbrain" (pun with "kite")...

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
OK... "@slowbrain"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.640
"What is your opinion on drawing lots, that remains the most democratic way of selecting people?"

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.140
Well no, it's not THE most democratic mean. That's not true.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.300
It's a democratic mean among others.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:02.780
When you draw lots, you hope that you will statistically obtain a fair representation

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.320
of all the points of views in society. I understand this idea.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.820
By the way, when we established the first representative assembly of "La France Insoumise" in Lille,

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.800
we drew lots to choose 2/3 of the members, so I'm not afraid of this method.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.220
But these 2/3 did at least agree with one idea: the candidate for the election, me.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.600
There has to be a minimum of consent to draw lots.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.560
So we'll draw lots to choose some members, and the rest will be elected. Why is that?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.380
Well it's because some problems cannot be solved by drawing lots.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.120
There has to be people who express and defend their opinion,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.040
and then people say: "Yes, well, he said that, the other guy said that,  and this woman defends another thesis..."

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.760
We give it some thinking! And then the people we chose by drawing lots show their good faith,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.460
they think, they hear contradictory opinions and settle the matter.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.540
So if we want to make a choice between different opinions, we have to elect some of the members of the assembly.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.700
To take the example of the constitution, some people advocate a parliamentary system.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.760
All right? It means that the Parliament has the final say under any circumstances, it organizes everything.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.420
Other people advocate a presidential system.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.640
They think the President should have extensive powers,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.680
although he has to be under the control of the assembly.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.060
And there are people who think it has to be an in-between solution.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.940
For instance, the President could have extensive powers

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.020
but he could be removed from office at any moment

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.680
and the assembly could show it disapproves of his action or whatnot.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.320
We need to discuss all this, don't we ?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.020
And to tell you the truth, I advocate a parliamentary system,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.440
but sometimes, I think: "Well, I should listen to  other people's opinions".

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.200
Anyway,!

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.040
This is the reason why we will not only draw lots.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.180
We need to elect representatives and to choose representative by drawing lots.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.960
Of course, the most important aspect is the gender parity in the assembly,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.960
there has to be as many women as there are men,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.140
and in this, drawing lots is very useful.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.480
It will enable us to have a fair representation of the social diversity of the country.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:06.200
Without it, you will get the same people who already had the courage to stand as candidates.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.540
I know that!

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.380
I come from this system, so I know what we're dealing with.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.600
So you're right to insist on the fact that we need to draw lots.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.760
Now "Mehdi la Suède" - why not - says:

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.840
"How should the process of the constituent assembly take place?"

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.340
Well, I just explained this process: first, a referendum, we convene an assembly,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.060
we make elections, we draw lots, and this assembly doesn't meet in the National Assembly but somewhere else.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.440
Someone else says:

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.800
"How do you intend to implement your program if you leave office right after a constituent assembly was established?"

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.920
I never said I would resign - Mehdi Hussain said that.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.260
When I become President, I will be elected within the framework of the 5th Republic,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.640
and I'll use an article from the constitution of the 5th Republic to convene the constituent assembly

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.020
that will meet and work, and while it does that,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.740
while it writes a new constiution, I'll be the President.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:02.200
And I hope that there will be a majority of "La France Insoumise" deputies in the National Assembly

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.580
to support the government's decisions.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.800
that I will appoint in accordance with the constitution of the 5th Republic.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.380
Thus, we'll get started right away, as soon as we take office,

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.020
a lot of measures will be ready.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.780
And then when the constituent assembly finishes its work,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.620
the text will be presented to the French people,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.020
the French people vote yes, then this text immediately comes into effect,

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.660
and I will no longer be President so that the new institutions may come into effect.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.360
I won't spin a yarn, you know.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.920
I'm not going to tell you: "You just wrote a new constitution that does not apply to me".

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.920
Of course it will apply to me!

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.860
So if the French people vote yes, then this constitution will apply to me and I'll leave office.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.720
Maybe I'll stand as a candidate again, but I don't think so.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.840
Anyway, that's the way it'll happen.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.000
There won't be any break and I won't leave office a week after I'm elected

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.880
and say goodbye while you'll have to start from scratch.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.680
That's not the way it'll happen! I will implement the policies from my program as long as I'll be in office

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.840
because the French people will have decided that.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.200
But I'll have a say in this constituent assembly.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.460
The difficulty is that I cannot say:

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.320
"I propose to elect a constituent assembly

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.500
but I, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, I'm going to tell you what the constitution will be".

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:13.000
Some people want to do that. They say they'll propose a constitution, and there will be a vote on this text.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
This was General De Gaulle's method,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.700
but that's not our method, we don't intend to organize a plebiscite!

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.000
There has to be a debate, people have to fight for their opinions,

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.440
they have to argue and make their own opinion.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.820
We should not be afraid of debating, of having contradictory opinions.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.820
Sometimes, the debate heats up, so what?

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.820
It gets cooler after a while, we're not savages, are we?

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.020
As for me, I'll make propositions during the constituent process,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.560
but I won't tell you what you have to put in the constitution.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.800
One of my propositions concerns the guarantee of civil liberties,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.580
like the right to abortion ,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.300
or the right to die with dignity and to decide when we want to die.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.840
This means that you are the owner of your body and of your conscience.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.840
Do you hear me folks? Your body!

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.440
You are the only owner of your body. It doesn't belong to other people, to your family, your husband or your children.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.860
It belongs to you.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.400
It's very important, it is the supreme civil liberty.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.060
And this goes for the right to abortion and for assisted suicide.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.980
But you know, as things go quickly, I'd rather be clear.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.120
I never said that I advocated abortion, I advocate the right to abortion. It's not the same thing!

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.200
I know the problem of abortion doesn't arises differently for everyone,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.940
depending on your life, on your personality or on the context etc.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.340
Likewise, when I say that I advocate assisted suicide, it doesn't mean that I want you to commit suicide,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.180
or that I want to commit suicide, that's not the issue here!

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.860
I'm saying this because people always exaggerate my ideas.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.540
No sooner did I finish a sentence that someone says something that makes a debate impossible.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.940
So I spoke about these fundamental liberties, but I have a third proposition, it is the green rule,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.160
which consists in forbidding to exploit the resources of the earth more than it can regenerate them.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.180
It would compel us to come up with good ideas to change our ways of producing.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.500
There's also another idea that I find very important, it is the right to dismiss elected representatives.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500
And I mean every representatives. We should be able to dismiss them.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.380
To do that, we would use the method of the recall referendum.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.040
A number of citizens who say: "No, this guy can't remain in office any longer!"

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.800
That guy is even worse! Just look at what he did! He lied to us, he betrayed and fooled us".

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.820
I'm not accusing anyone, you can find them by yourselves.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:27.120
OK, so a recall referendum consists in gathering a number of signatures, a million for instance,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.120
or maybe two, to overthrow the President of the Republic,

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.200
50,000 for a regional councillor... You got the point, right?

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.720
And when you have enough signatures and signatories' polling card number,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.100
well we can organize a referendum: should he stay or should he go? That's it!

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.020
Some people told me: "But people are are going to vote everyday!" Well, no, people aren't so stupid.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.800
First, you won't find one or two million signature just like that!

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.740
You see? People should stop giving extreme examples to prevent ideas from progressing.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.360
It enables the people to have an eye on their representatives all the time,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.940
but it also gives stability to institutions.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.560
Because don't tell me that we'll run a great country like France

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.880
with the system of the permanent general assembly, because I'm not buying it, it's not possible.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.040
How long should it take to establish a constituent assembly?"

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.820
We'll do it quickly! we just need the time to establish the new assembly.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.800
There's a six-week period between the first round of the presidential election and the first round of the parliamentary elections,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.820
four weeks if we start counting from the second round.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.940
After that, we have to take office and then have the National Assembly vote the organization of a constituent assembly,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:41.000
so around September 2017, we'll be able to organize the election of the constituent assembly.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.140
Now it's written that there's a "funny question". Why is that?

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.880
@Luccio asks me: "Where does your swag come from?"

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.300
Well...

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.960
It's natural, that's why.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.900
@Christophe Geoffroy: "Conferences, public meetings, visits, interviews, videos, written articles...

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.640
Where does your energy come from?"

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.280
I don't know... I really don't.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.800
But let me tell you that when I relax...

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.660
I can sleep for 12 or 13 hours, you should know that.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.580
But I haven't done that for a very long time.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:23.000
I think that when you do things passionately, and when people react positively...

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.660
I mean I have to tell it like it is, when I talk to people, they react positively,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.600
they're kind and friendly for the most part.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.500
I don't know if there are many countries in which a candidate to a presidential election

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.300
that comes third or fourth in the polls - I come third right now -

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.400
can take the metro alone without being accompanied by bodyguards. Is there a country where it is possible? Well in France it is!

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.000
And yet it is the country of moaners!

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.440
The French are always described as a bunch of savages abroad.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.840
When you hear what the English say about us, you'd think our country is a jungle.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.320
Well, yes, it is a jungle, there are all sorts of cool ways of life here.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.520
Of course, we are just the way we are in this country,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.700
but for the most part, people are rather kind and pleasant, those I see in the subway at least.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.720
Maybe people who don't take the subway are unpleasant.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.200
For instance, when I walk in the street, I see people honking like lunatics for no reason.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.660
But people in the subway don't do that, and everything goes fine.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.900
@ET.G: "Did you read the manga comic 'Jean-Luc Mélenchon No Revolution', and what do you think of it?"

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.900
Yes, I did.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.480
It didn't take much time to read it, because there are balloons.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.460
In French, they are called "phylactères".

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.320
I liked the author's drawings and the offbeat aspect of this comic.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.860
Besides it's an honor. It's not everyone that has a manga comic about them!

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.680
In the story, I ruthlessly fight my enemies, it's in my nature.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.940
The author perfectly understood how determined I am.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:49.660
I am grateful to David Chabant, I am very flattered that he wrote a manga comic about me,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.500
and I'm mad at my staff because they stole the only copy I had from me.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:02.820
I lost the only copy I had, and the author still hasn't sent me the comic with his inscription on it,

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.840
I hope he'll get the message.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.820
Also, I'd be really happy if he offered me a strip. I would have it framed

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.340
and I would put it at home, in my living room maybe.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.940
I mean, there aren't so many people who have a comic about them.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.660
"Do you intend to impose the use of Quinoa..."

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.040
Honestly, @Teddy Bear...

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.420
Was that question that necessary?

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.400
"Do you intend to impose the use of quinoa in school canteens if by the greatest of miracles you happened to..."

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.000
I do feel like the question is critical! Let me resume.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.400
"Do you intend to impose the use of quinoa in school canteens if by the greatest of miracles you happened to be elected?"

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.200
First, it wouldn't be a miracle if I was elected, it would be the result of an election,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.580
and let me tell you that an election isn't a miracle.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.800
Besides, would it be the greatest of miracles? No, it would not.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.840
There are even greater miracles like walking on water, but I'm not capable of that.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.060
Apparently, very few people had the power to do that in the course of history.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.820
Do I intend to impose the use of quinoa?

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.200
Let's suppose that I answered yes. I can see the headlines already: "Mélenchon wants to impose the use of quinoa!"

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:03.180
I talked about quinoa because I want people to understand that we have to stop consuming meat proteines.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.720
Suppose I said: "We have to stop using meat proteins!"

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.940
I would then give you statistics, but people would get bored and say "Next!"

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.920
Of course you would!

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.880
Especially if I added that we have to use vegetable proteins only.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.040
Your head would swell and you just could not stand it any longer.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.460
So I talked about quinoa, I showed the way I cook it, and I said that we couldn't continue to use meat proteins.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:30.480
And it worked well, because right after the interview, a pack of journalists started dressing me down

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.060
barking: "Look! Mélenchon became a vegetarian!"

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:38.200
but I'm not a vegetarian, I just try to eat as little meat proteins as possible.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.160
What matters is that it makes people think: "The guy is right!

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.600
We don't want to keep eating all this meat

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.200
at the expense of animals that go through atrocious suffering.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.500
Besides, it's not healthy, and the meat quality is poor because it is knacker's meat.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.280
Got it? So I won't impose the use of quinoa, but I'll force you to think about it.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:04.580
As for school canteens, it is true that we will impose 100% organic food on them.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.460
We need to use 100% organic food from local productions.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:12.640
How come you just can't find anyone that grows carrots for 150 miles around

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.600
wherever you may be in the country! Did you know that?

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.560
Well inform yourselves about carrots and you'll see.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.160
"Cannabis legalization"

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.760
"@Lord nal... nagalfar"

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.740
Lord! How humble!

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.140
"Considering the good results obtained by the countries in which it was implemented,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.720
what is your opinion on cannabis legalization, in all its aspects?"

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.960
Yes, you mean smoking joints and not just the medical use?

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.620
That's what you mean, right? You're just afraid to put it like this, am I wrong, Lord Nagalfar?

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.700
Come on! Don't be such a chicken!

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:55.460
Now, the next question is from "@Mokritzy"... No! "@MokritZKy"!

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.040
"A lot of people" - don't be so sure! -

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.000
"wonder if we should we legalize it or not? And why?"

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.540
OK!

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.660
"@Miyajacky":

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.560
Hello, and thank you. Do you think cannabis legalization could be economically and socially beneficial to France?"

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.400
First, I don't care if it's good on the social and economic level.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.680
What matters is to deal with the use of cannabis as a public health problem.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.340
I am not in favor of the use of cannabis, but I am in favor of its legalization

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.280
because I am against the use of cannabis. That's my first point.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.240
When a substance is forbidden, it is not possible to campaign against it.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.100
It is logic. By the way, you see all sorts of horrific campaigns against the use of tobacco,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:43.780
but you never see campaigns that say: "Look pals, if you smoke too much marijuana bla bla,

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.120
it's going to ruin your health". Because it does!

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.700
I'm talking about the recreational use of marijuana, not about other types uses

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.400
like therapeutic, psychologic uses or whatnot.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:01.240
So, to me, it is important that we be able to campaign against the use of marijuana,

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.420
but to do that, we have to legalize it.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.420
It's as simple as that!

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.340
If you want to make prevention campaigns, then you have to legalize it!

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:14.020
If you don't, if you're satisfied with today's terrific situation...

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:20.400
People have to find all sorts of ways to hide a few grams!

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.820
If you happen to be arrested with a few grams of hashish,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.320
then it's the end of the world and you're immediately sent to the police station.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.900
And if in addition to that you are caught sticking posters

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.320
or making unpleasant graffitis on the walls, well your punishment is even more severe,

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.540
because you are considered a suspicious person!

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.540
I mean, let's be serious!

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.160
This trade forms the basis for huge traffics,

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.360
and it is a waste of time for policemen,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.160
it is a waste of time for judges, who could use this time for other objectives.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:59.720
This explains why you'll be satisfied if you're in favor of legalization, but also disappointed,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.380
I am absolutely opposed to the use of marijuana, which is why I want to legalize it.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.780
And don't call me a hypocrit!

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.040
The hypocrisy is the ban on cannabis, when everyone knows that the use of marijuana is widely spread.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.540
People smoke it everywhere, and there's no way to stop it!

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.800
I will be called a hypocrit because my way of fighting it is legalization,

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.400
but no one says how hypocritical it is when there's a marijuana traffic on your block and that...

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.660
What do you do in this case, pal? Do you call the police to make it stop the traffic?

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.780
No, you don't! You even buy some!

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.580
So enough! Enough with hypocrisy! It is a waste of time and a waste of money!

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.080
It ruins people's health! We have to get down to business now!

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.880
I hope my answer will initiate a debate.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.680
To tell you the truth, I must admit it took me some time to come to this conclusion.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.720
I used to think that legalizing the use of marijuana amounted to encouraging it.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.120
Now you know.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.560
And some of my friends came to tell me: "Don't do that! You're crazy!"

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.700
But on the contrary, I think that I'd be crazy to say we should carry on like that.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.400
Let me explain how I came to this conclusion.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.200
I read some articles with different points of view about this issue, but not only French articles.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.280
I read articles from different countries, experiences in different countries, and they convinced me.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.000
Of course, I'm ready to hear contrary opinions, but since you asked my opinion, I give it to you.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.620
Now "@JesuisSousCôté" says:

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.680
"What made you want to make videos on Youtube? Do you work on your own?"

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.900
Well it's quite pathetic actually.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.300
At first, I was tired. I did not have time, often.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.840
I mean I was under pressure. I write articles on my blog every week.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.160
So the whole planet laughs at me because I probably write the longest blog articles in the world.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.900
They're about 30,000 characters long when they're concise,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.980
and 40,000 characters long the rest of the time!

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.700
I basically write the equivalent of a book every two months!

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.960
My articles amount to a book.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:04.160
So I feel stressed when I did everything I had to, because I know I have to get behind my keyboard

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.260
for two hours or more. It takes a lot of time!

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.700
Besides, my staff gives me notes, drafts sometimes, but mostly notes,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.160
and then I do a synthesis, and I keep it in mind as I write.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.960
So I decided we would do things differently. I set a camera on my desk

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.600
and I thought I would record all that on my computer.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.540
To be honest, this was not reasonable, so I stopped.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.880
I therefore asked Antoine Nicolas for help. He works with me on these issues.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:37.720
He tried to make me understand nicely that I just could not do it, and that it would not be good if I did that on my own.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.620
I did one or two videos behind my computer, but I got it now, it's over!

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.020
Besides, I had to show my appartment, and it always took me 2 hours to find the proper angle!

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.000
It was really bad, so we decided to do as we do now.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.760
So we got started! I told Antoine: "Look, let's get down to business, I need to do a weekly review".

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.480
So that's the way it started! We weren't really prepared. I just prepared my topics, read my notes,

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.900
and poof, we got to work! And now I'm used to it!

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:09.540
Speaking is not the hardest part for me, it's easier than writing.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.700
That's the way we had the idea, and then I...

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.600
In the beginning, I watched some Youtubers' videos, and I liked it.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.660
I don't want to make people jealous, so I won't say who, but I did, and some of them were really funny.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.180
So I got started, and besides, some of my friends started to do the same.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:35.600
So I had a look at the work of my relatives, like Danielle Simonnet's videos for instance.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.880
I was really impressed!

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.900
I liked it, and besides, I felt freer in the way I worked. So that's how I got the idea!

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.200
Do I work on my own? No, I don't. There's Antoine Nicolas...

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.720
and other friends, but I did not ask them if they wanted me to give their names, so I won't say who they are.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.960
There's the guy behind the camera for instance. I won't say his name, but he's there.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:03.960
We are... Two persons help me.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.120
After we filmed, they spend hours editing the videos. The videos look like there aren't any interruptions, but that's not the case actually.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:15.940
I need to stop to drink, to answer the phone when my damn phone won't stop ringing,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.800
which makes me think something serious happened. You know what I mean!

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.620
This was my answer, dear @JesuisSousCôté!

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.960
Now @Bridd asks:

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.920
"What made ya wanna be a Youtuber?"

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.400
I just answered the question!

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.440
I thought it was easy, but I was wrong!

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.920
Being a Youtuber is complicated.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.200
I'm saying this for those who think you just need to sit and talk to your camera for hours.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.160
There's preparation, there's work while we film,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.260
and there's work after that, because we have to edit the videos. It's a lot of work!

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.220
I'd like it to be natural but it's not possible!

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.340
@Pierre Fournier:

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.240
"Could your Youtube channel become important enough to make you abandon the traditional media?"

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:01.980
So...

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:09.680
Dear Pierre, you just put your finger on a strategy that we are working on.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.280
We've been working on this for months.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.660
The idea is that we need to be able to bypass the official media system, because it stands like a wall!

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:26.720
Of course, it's not an absolutely smooth wall, there are niches where you're free to talk,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.720
but for the most part, it's full of traps and ambushes all the time.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.820
They say: "Come, we'll ask you questions about your program", but in reality they don't ask me anything.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:43.900
They just want me to comment on such and such person, and sometimes, someone suddenly appears and asks a question although he was not supposed to.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.180
In the traditional media, you always feel like you're taking an oral exam. They ask me:

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.880
"Do you know how many legs a centipede has?", so I say "Yes, yes, a hundred",

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:58.780
"No! It's 785! You want to be President of the Republic and you don't even know that?!"

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:04.800
Well no, I didn't! You always feel like you're taking an oral exam in a prestigious university. It allows a caste to reproduce itself

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.200
because you end up thinking: "Well I'm not like them, I don't know everything".

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.260
But they do not know everything, they just learned their notes, that's all!

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.640
In this manner, they create a void around them, and no one dares to do anything!

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.420
So you see people with incredible jobs that require skills and knowledge

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.720
who feel ashamed and confused, but who makes them feel like that?

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.400
Just a bunch of showmen who ask the same questions to everyone!

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.960
Anyway, I'm not going to criticize the media system right now.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.860
The media system is above all a machine that crushes human beings, journalists in particular,

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.220
who are poorly paid and whose contracts are temporary and uneven.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.520
It is also a machine that puts people in a box.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:54.660
By the way, you should notice that they ask the same questions to everyone, so the system manufactures the public opinion.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.920
It is so true that when I attend meetings, some people tell me:

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.540
"So some people will ask you questions", and what are these questions?

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.940
The same questions that the journalists ask me! So I end up thinking it's not worth it,

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.220
if I have to answer these questions, I'd better do it on TV.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.460
So the idea is to bypass the system, but that's easy to say.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.440
Some people were categorical and told me "Don't go to TV or radio shows, period!"

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.240
I understand this, but then what?

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.340
Do I have to put a bag on my face to look like it's not me? Should I shut up and be invisible?

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.280
Let's be serious! I have to join the fray!

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.640
But I must select the shows I go to, I don't want to be treated like an object.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.920
That's what the system wants, to turn you into an object.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:38.980
It creates a buzz, it puts you in a box... I know what they expect me to say, so I play with their expectations.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:45.080
I do this to draw a bit of the public attention , but I need to bypass the system.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.540
So we created a good system.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:54.760
I think it is quite efficient, because something like 541,000 people subscribed to my Facebook page.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.060
541,000 people, it's like a show with a good audience.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.060
Almost 900,000 people follow me on Twitter.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:07.940
It would have been a dream for me back when I was a young political activist who just handed out his damn tracts on the street.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.240
You just type 140 characters and poof! 900,000 people get it!

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.260
And there's this Youtube channel of course!

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.300
It made a sudden breakthrough since we are now 70,000 subscribers.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.400
We're also the leading political channel in  France.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.560
Of course, some Youtubers have a thousand time more subscribers than I have, but they're in their own domain.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.860
I'm in politics, people aren't crazy about that!

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.080
The number of subscribers is going to grow as the election is drawing near,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.500
but you're right Pierre, it's a way of bypassing the system.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.280
Someone made a criticism that was a bit nasty. This person said:

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:52.920
"Look! He's boasting of using his own communication tools, but he's trying to avoid embarrassing questions!"

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.900
Ha, ha! Embarrassing questions in the official media!

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.680
What embarrassing questions? They're all written beforehand!

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.280
They think I don't know the questions they'll ask me!

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.960
But it doesn't matter! As long as they believe it, they're off my back!

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.320
@Damien Charpentier:

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:13.400
"Hello Mr. Mélenchon, you are now on Youtube, on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, and even on Snapchat!"

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.860
Are you trying to get closer to the young, or are you just addicted to social media?"

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.960
Well, I must admit that I'm getting addicted to it, and it's not a good thing!

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:28.520
By the way, you're all spending more time on your smartphone than anything else,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.840
more than people in front of you sometimes.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.580
Beware!

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.120
I mean I use these tools, so I won't lecture at you about it,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:42.680
but it does look like an addiction, meaning that you lost control over them

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.920
and that it makes you suffer when you can't use them.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.840
It reminds me of when I was a smoker, it was the same!

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.760
I smoked and smoked, and I couldn't quit.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.260
And now, I sometimes think it is the same with my smartphone.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:58.420
I have it with me everywhere I go, and when I don't, I feel stressed, and I wonder what's going to happen.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:04.220
I think we went a bit too far. So I'm not an addict... I mean I am, but I try not to.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.800
Now do I want to speak to the young? Not at all!

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:13.520
I don't speak to the young, and then to blond-haired people, then to brown-haired people, then to the elderly...

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.860
I speak to everyone, and I speak to everyone in the same way.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.860
I don't speak differently just because I speak to a young person.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:27.040
I speak in the same way because I think that we all have the same intellectual abilities to understand each other

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.460
if everyone tries to speak a language that others can understand.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.240
This is true for everyone, you know? The problem with politicians

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.120
is that they often think they have a code in their head and that no one knows it.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.120
This is true of every occupation.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.160
When you speak to someone who is addicted to his job, you'll see

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.360
that often, you won't understand anything when he speaks.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.020
So, no, I speak to everyone in the same way,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.280
and I use these tools in order to bypass the official media

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.620
and also as a way of - let's tell it like it is -

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.180
being more creative, for the thrill of doing things.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.900
@Dimichu asks:

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.200
"How is your campaign funded? :)"

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:10.040
So... There's a smiley face at the end, so I suppose @Dimichu means "This is your chance to tell us".

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.120
Well I will, thank you! My campaign is funded by people's contributions.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.100
I can't continue to campaign if I don't get funds.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:28.340
I also got a loan from the Parti de Gauche (Left Party), the only party that helped funding the campaign,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.720
and normally, I should be able to pay off this loan at the end of the campaign.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:39.380
I mean the banker would follow me to hell to get his money back.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.120
The Parti de Gauche will get its money back too.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:48.360
And those who gave money get a... you know, a tax deduction slip.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:53.640
They can get a tax deduction that amounts to 60% of the sum they gave me.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.700
You might argue that "you have to pay taxes in the first place". OK, that's true,

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.480
but for those who do pay taxes, you get a 60% deduction!

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.200
I don't think people should get a tax deduction for giving money to a movement, but it's possible and it's the law!

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:11.360
So that's how we fund the campaign, and we just started a fund-raiser.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:16.960
I must admit that we like big paychecks, but there's a 4,500€ legal limit.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.380
We do like big paychecks, that's true,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.740
but we also like it when you send us money each month, it's easier and we take it all!

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:34.320
We take it all because when you see all the money that the Republican party collected

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.280
with their primary election... I mean well done! Well done!

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.300
10 million€! 10 million€ in two rounds!

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.700
And among the voters, you find 400,000 "left-wing" simpletons who payed 2€

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.440
to vote for one candidate in order to prevent another candidate to run for president...

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.800
This is crazy! They were fooled, but can you realize that they gave...

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.160
They were 400,000 "left-wing" voters apparently, some say 600,000, but I'll use the lowest figure

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.820
so that they don't feel ashamed too much. So how much does 400,000 multiplied by 2€?

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.140
800,000€! Why did they not give it to me?

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:10.120
So you want to give money to the right? Instead of me? Come on...!

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.900
Anyway, I'm sure you did not! But you can make a donation, it will be welcome!

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.020
"What can you say to those who think the far right is already in the second round of the elction?"

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.240
That's @Hugo's question, and here's my answer.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:28.900
It is a mistake to think that you can know the result of an election in advance.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.120
The election has to take place to know the result.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.320
So, listen! I don't want to reveal this secret,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.820
but thinking that the far right will reach the second round of the election is convenient for a lot of people.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.600
They're doing this for the second time. The did the same in 2012.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.760
They announced that they would be in the second round bla bla, but they were not!

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.580
So it is convenient for a lot of people,

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.020
but what is interesting is that some people believe their own propaganda

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.380
So they organize their campaign according to a prediction that might not become true.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.140
All this is great, isn't it? There's no better way to make a mistake

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.360
than believing the lies you tell others.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.240
So saying Mrs. Le Pen will reach the second round is convenient for a lot of people.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:17.120
As for me, I couldn't care less because all I can do is convince voters.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.260
Besides, what's the point of standing as a candidate if you don't think you can convince voters?

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:26.240
An election is not a game. Voters aren't kids, they're adults!

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.640
They're citizens, and citizens think!

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.820
@Florent Rué:

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:36.840
"Don't you think shareholders will back off if their voting rights are modulated according to the duration of their investments in a company?"

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.780
No it won't!

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.220
But first, you need to understand.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:47.440
I propose that shareholders' voting rights be proportionate to the duration of their investment,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.880
which means that someone who says "Well I'll invest money"

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.660
"For how long, Sir?"

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.800
"It's none of your business!"

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.420
"Yes it is, because if you take your money back, my company will go out of business!"

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.740
So to me, shareholders should say how long they want to invest their money.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.820
For instance, if you don't want to say how long - it's your right -

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:09.720
if you don't want to say how long you want to invest, then you won't have any voting right as a shareholder.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.960
If you want to choose the minimum investment period, let's say 3 years, or 5,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.380
then you will get half a voting right per share,

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.920
and if it's 10 years, then you will get a full voting right per action.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.580
But you might argue that it's not an anti-capitalist measure.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.780
Well I'm talking about listed companies here.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.040
Did you get the point? This measure aims at preventing vampires to hit the road with the funds of a company.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.700
Those who do that are called "vulture funds", that's their specialty. I'll tell you how they do that.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.300
They contract a loan from a bank... You always find money when you play these dirty tricks!

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.320
Thank you bankers!

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:50.420
So they buy a company, and once they own it, they suck out all the company's funds to pay back their loan.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.000
Sometimes they keep the company working a bit to get some surplus value.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.140
So they pay back their loan, and then they sell all the rest:

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.420
patents, the order book, even the building sometimes - the walls, the floor, everything!

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.740
You might not be aware of it because you're not used to this kind of things,

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:11.980
but there was a company that was part of a larger former company, a chemical company,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.820
I think the name was "Kem One".

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.880
They made PVC. They really were great guys!

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.360
PVC is used to make gutters, things like that...

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.520
It was the only company that did that in France! There were 3 factories!

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.180
A guy bought it for 1€! Can you believe that?

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.140
1€!

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.780
There were 2,900 employees and 3 factories, and do you know what the guy did?

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.280
He thought a 10% benefit was not enough,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.800
so he sold it all! Everything!

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.940
We have to prevent shareholders who buy a company from selling it, they production  tools,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.660
and by this I don't mean business and all these liberal tall tales,

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.900
I mean machines and workers, people who have skills.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.980
So will that deter people from investing? Well no, on the contrary!

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.640
Suppose you have a few savings. You want to invest it in a company that does well,

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.840
not a company that will make you say: "What?

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.080
A hedge fund bought shares in this company? I want to get out of this thing!"

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.880
Because the hedge fund or the pension fund can hit the road whenever it wants,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.240
and you'll lose all your savings because the company will go bankrupt.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.780
So on the contrary, we will give stability to investors.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.320
Now, listen! If you have doubts about this, let me give you another argument.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.900
There was a time when business was going well in Brazil

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.120
- it's no longer the case right now - but it did.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.040
There was private money all over the place, in every company,

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.000
and what did Brazilians do?

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.160
They asked for term deposits. They said: "Brazil is not a station hall,

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.860
so if you want to invest, you have to leave a term deposit,

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.820
and if you want to leave in less than 3 years, you can, but we'll keep the deposit.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.800
And this was not a joke! There were deposits of 10 or 20%

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.700
the total investment, these were susbstantial deposits!

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:03.300
You see? And it did not prevent business from going well.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.620
What really matters is the order book, because if it is full,

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.660
then you can be sure that someone will pay the machines and the workers.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.380
I hope I answered your question.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.940
@Nadia Fufette asks: "You have been a whistleblower on TAFTA and then CETA..."

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.240
- TAFTA is the free trade agreement with the USA,

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.180
and CETA is the free trade agreement with CANADA -

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.300
"Please tell us about TISA that is being negotiated in Geneva".

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:38.300
I already did it on my blog in June 2014,

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.180
so you can find all the information there.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:46.780
So yes, a treaty is being negotiated in order to - no need to be a smart cookie

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:53.000
to know what's going on - in order to make privatizations, to hit public services,

00:41:53.140 --> 00:42:00.880
to prevent states and local authorities from creating new public services that could compete with the private sector.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.120
It's a sort of Fillon-like global tendency that they try to implement (François Fillon=French conservative politician).

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:12.420
We will oppose it, of course, because this treaty would be the end of France and French public services.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.400
You should understand that public services mutualize some services, they are cheaper than private services,

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.660
but they try to make you think it is the contrary. But it's a lie, it's logical, everyone can understand that.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:27.020
If a public service provides citizens with a quality service, it has to be controled, but it provides you with a service.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.220
Now a private service is not a monopoly, so there are at least 2 or 3 different companies,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:38.040
and as a consequence, there are advertisement fees that are unnecessary in the public service.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.460
Private services are also a waste of money!

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.020
Why making different investments to provide people with the same service? Why?

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:50.100
Why doing things twice, thrice or more? It's a waste of money on the scale of society.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.100
I hope you're not stupid enough to believe

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.600
that you don't pay private services' additional costs in the end, because you always pay them one way or another.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:03.380
When you buy products, you give money to capital that takes its share,

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.120
while the rest of the money is used to buy machines. But you always pay it in the end.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.500
So read my blog article on the subject. My blog is a powerful tool.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.660
It is the leading political blog in the country... or the second maybe, and I'm proud of that.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.740
You can find this article in the articles of June 2014.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.220
@Lassalas Maxime:

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.860
"What is your opinion on whistleblowers like Assange and Snowden?

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.900
Would you accept to grant them asylum in France?

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:37.600
Ok, so let me give you a piece of information, and let's see when it reaches the official media.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.980
Let me tell you very solemnly that my opinion on Assange and Snowden

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:48.120
is that they did a great service to democracy and freedom in the world

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:52.660
when they revealed how the USA spied on everyone,

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:58.640
our country in particular, as well as the political and economic leaders of our country.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.340
We owe Mr Assange and Mr Snowden a lot.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.000
Now, what will I do if I am elected President of France?

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.760
Well I will grant French citizenship to Mr Assange and Mr Snowden,

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:15.940
and as they will be our fellow citizens, I will ask  the countries where they are living now

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.640
to allow them to come to France, their new country,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.500
where they'll be able to travel freely and to live their life freely.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:33.680
You probably know that Mr Assange has been living in a tiny room for three years.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.580
I visited him once.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.120
He cannot leave the room, because the police is waiting for him outside,

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.380
in order to arrest him under the pretext of... There's always a good reason!

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.980
The police would arrest him under the pretext of a so-called rape case in Sweden.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:56.120
There is a legal action against him, but he was neither indicted nor sentenced!

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.720
It's just a legal action!

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.360
He's always said he would agree to answer the prosecutor's questions,

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.400
but he refuses to leave the embassy without the guarantee that he won't be arrested,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:12.040
because if he agreed to leave the embassy to answer the prosecutor's questions,

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:16.100
the Swedes would extradite him to the USA - they already did that once -

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:21.200
and Americans would put him in jail incommunicado as they did with his friend Chelsea Manning

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.920
who's been held incommunicado and ill-treated for many years.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.220
North-Americans are violent and crual people.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.900
For instance, there's an official torture center in Guantanamo, on the island of Cuba.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:42.560
They were vicious enough to set this center in Cuba! There's an American military base there.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:48.420
Many people have been tortured there for years, and it's done officially, because a law was voted.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.120
That's American democracy you know. This law makes waterboarding legal.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:59.140
A prisoner's head can be dipped into water until they are almost drowned, but not completely, that would be crual you know!

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.060
So they passed this law, and everyone knows this, it could not be more official!

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:08.460
There are CIA's secret prisons in Europe, but shhh! Don't say a word about this!

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.620
Now when the media talk about Cuba, they don't talk about Guantanamo's torture center.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:19.520
They rather accuse Fidel and Raul Castro of being dictators.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:23.200
Sorry, I'm a bit off the topic. So first, I'll grant them French citizenship.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:30.140
Second, I'll ask the countries in which they are living now, that is, Russia in the case of Mr Snowden,

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:36.000
and the UK in the case of Mr Assange, to allow them to come to their country, France.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:42.900
And once they'll be in France, I think that... Of course I would do this if I become President of the Republic,

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.400
I could not do this if I was not.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.460
Well I would decorate them. Since the President of the Republic is the highest authority of the Legion of Honor,

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.860
I would present them with the Legion of Honor for services to the nation.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.840
Ok, so... If I am elected, I will do it, mark my words!

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:09.800
I want the whole world to know that France will not be spied on with impunity.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:18.300
I want the whole world to know that we have the right to access the information collected by Mr Assange and Mr Snowden.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.860
Ok. So now is the time to reveal a secret piece of news.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.940
I will soon meet Mr Assange again, and probably Mr Snowden too.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.680
I'll tell you more about that next time.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.660
So you should listen to Jean-Luc Mélenchon's answers in his FAQs,

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.940
because you might find information that you won't find elsewhere.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.940
This is all for this FAQ.

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:45.880
I will answer other questions in a new video, because I already answered more than 20 questions today.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.540
If you liked the video, let me know by giving me the blue thumbs up,

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.160
and... I mean one blue thumb per person, and subscribe to my channel

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:05.860
because everyone can see it when the channel's audience is increasing,

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:13.720
and it gives courage to those who are working on the videos, and it gives me courage.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:19.600
Besides, this informal way of informing is helpful.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:25.360
And if it works for me, it works for other politicians, who could do the same out of jealousy,

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:32.380
and maybe it will enable you to know about people you didn't know before.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.200
Thank you and see you soon!
