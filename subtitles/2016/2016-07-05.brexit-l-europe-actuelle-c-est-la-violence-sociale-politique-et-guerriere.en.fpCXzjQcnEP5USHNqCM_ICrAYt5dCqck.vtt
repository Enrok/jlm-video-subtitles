00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.900
You say you intend to take notice of England's exit from the EU

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.000
and that to do that, we very sadly need to reform Europe.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800
But you take heed not to explain how you intend to do that.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.000
The only thing we have heard until now is that Mr SchÃ¤uble saying that

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for him, Europe's future development had to go through an even more rigid

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
control of the nation states' budgets

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.300
and an even more rigid control of the social rules

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.000
that are destroying our societies for the benefit of the capital.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.900
I think the Europe that has been built is a Europe of social violence,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.000
as we can see it in each country, everytime a posted worker

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.900
steals the job of a local worker.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.900
A Europe of political violence as we saw it in Cyprus and Greece.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.000
A Europe of war violence, as the war you are preparing against Russia.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.500
All this is insane!

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.600
Let me repeat what the peoples of Europe have not stopped telling you :

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400
either you change this Europe for the benefit of human beings,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.800
or we will all leave it, because no one wants to live any longer in such a union

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.800
that opposes every single thing people do for their life and their children's.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.900
Until then, the truth is that we must either change Europe or leave it.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.200
You have to hear this lesson.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.600
No, the citizens of Great-Britain are not racists or xenophobes.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
Voting 'no' does not mean voting for war and against Europe.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.000
It is just the opposite.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The vote of the British citizens, like the vote of the French in 2005, is a vote in favor of the union of peoples,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for peace and social coordination.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.400
But you don't want that !
