00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.900
You said you intended to recognise England's exit from the EU

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.000
and that to do that, we very sadly needed to reform Europe.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800
But you took heed not to explain how you would do it.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.000
The only thing we've heard until now is that Mr SchÃ¤uble said that

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to him, Europe's future development had to go through an even more severe

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
control of nation states' budgets

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.300
and of the social rules

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.000
that are destroying our societies to the benefit of capital.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.900
I think the Europe that was built is a Europe of social violence,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.000
as we can see it in each country everytime a posted worker

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.900
steals the job of a local worker.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.900
A Europe of political violence as we saw it in Cyprus and Greece.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.000
A Europe of war violence, as the war you are preparing against Russia.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.500
This is insane!

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.600
Let me repeat what the peoples of Europe tell you all the time:

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400
this Europe has to be changed to the benefit of human beings

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.800
or we will all leave it, because no one wants to live in such a union any longer

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.800
if it opposes everything people do for their life or that of their children.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.900
Until then, the truth is that we must either change this Europe or leave it.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.200
You have to hear this lesson.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.600
No, the citizens of Great-Britain are not racists or xenophobes.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
Voting 'no' does not mean voting for war and against Europe.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.000
It is the opposite.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The vote of British citizens, like the vote of the French in 2005, is a vote in favor of the union of peoples,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for peace and social coordination.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.400
But you don't want that!
