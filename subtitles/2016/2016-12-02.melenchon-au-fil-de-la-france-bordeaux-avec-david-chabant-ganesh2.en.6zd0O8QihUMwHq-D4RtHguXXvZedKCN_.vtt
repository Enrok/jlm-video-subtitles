00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:09.749
We are going to sonorise the street,

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.110
I don't know how long you will have the patience to stay here,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.320
but know that you gave me an extraordinary strength and energy

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.900
and that I am very grateful for that. Glory to our ideas!

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.939
people understand perfectly that if this guy can announce to you

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.599
that he is going to do a rapid assault

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.599
it's because he has a constitution which is a permanent coup.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.580
And the permanent coup,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.260
Mr. Fillon will utilize it to do a social coup.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.680
His politics, it's a social coup. It is the destruction of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.950
government supportive health care. it is the destruction of the Work Code.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.580
It is a social coup.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.110
We are going to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
restore retirement age at 60 (Sarcastic laughter)

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.390
How do you pay that?

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.760
Mr. Mélenchon,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.550
retirement at 60, well, come on,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.200
what are you doing to these people, you are promising things,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.869
You don't know how to pay it... 
Of course I do!

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.869
We found an idea.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.190
Respect women.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.870
What do you mean?

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.250
If you pay women

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.350
the same way you pay men,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.020
well the additional social dues

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.020
will pay for the pension.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.060
My name is David Chabant, I do videos on

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.880
YouTube for the past 10 years

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.070
and if I am here now it's because I have done, following a...

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.520
a...

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.670
a funny tweet, and a little bit

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.740
with the idea of a challenge,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.420
a manga on Jean-Luc Mélenchon doing Kung-Fu.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.690
In fact, the idea is that

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.910
the various deputees

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.060
are about to vote a raise of about 500% of their

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.930
salary... they are capable of this by the way, maybe they will even do it...

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.810
now that this video will be published, who knows

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.500
and so, Mélenchon comes in and kicks their asses.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.780
because, I got it once and by the time I started it

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.649
I start to look at it and everything

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.419
You see, I look at something else, do other things and the people I work with, well...

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.460
they took it and said "Wait, we're gonna look at it" and then it disappeared...

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.979
The recent election of Mr. Fillon as the Chief of the Republicans Party

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:22.989
makes it

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.419
that someone else is needed,

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.419
do be a counter power if I may say.
