00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
What do they all agree on?

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.860
They don't agree on the number of civil servants:

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.860
One wants 100,000, another wants 300,000.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.320
They don't agree on the gifts to give to the employers:

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.200
One wants 35 billion, another wants only 17 billion.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.360
On the pension age neither:

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.920
One wants to make you work until you're 64

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.520
another until you're 70.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.000
Anyways you understand: there's debate...

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.180
And the debate must be enriched

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.160
But there's an issue on which they all agree

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.600
We must eliminate the ISF [ImpÃ´t sur la Fortune],

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.180
the Wealth Tax.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.440
Because if there's one thing you should understand, it's that

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.740
there's something that plummets the French economy

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.020
wears down on the spirits of the producers,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.520
cuts down our love for life,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.640
it's the ISF.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.480
They all agree.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.800
You're applauding - you know nothing of the economy

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.080
Because, I will explain,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.320
if the plate of the wealthy is so full that it's too full,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.080
it's going to spill over.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.340
And that's called "trickle-down".

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.020
No really, it's in economy textbooks.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.060
It's going to spill over into your plate.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.400
So if you permit the wealthy to get even more wealthy,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.460
it's going to trickle down, one day or another, into your plate

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.560
Why don't you believe it?

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.300
They are intelligent people

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.040
Darn, they're the ones who did the studies, not you!

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.260
Please, pull yourself together.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.580
You know what, I wonder how many people there are from the right-wing,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.580
because frankly, it's not because they're from the right

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580
that they pay the ISF.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.680
There are people who pay the ISF and who are leftist.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.800
No, but it's entirely possible - the conscience

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.480
depends on a lot of things.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.460
How many people does it concern, this topic

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.880
that they are so fascinated by?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.120
That they are trying to fix at all costs?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.760
Who are they addressing themselves to?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.880
How many electors did they have last time?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.500
A little over 20 million

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.200
Who are they addressing themselves to, how many people?

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.780
342,000

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.000
All this hot air, commotion, and attitude

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.380
It's for 1.7% of taxpayers

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.900
1.7%

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.020
They deserve as their score: 1.7%

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.540
Those who pay the ISF, vote for them
