00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Why is the Labour code so big?

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me tell you. Because it is full of exceptions.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.600
Who includes that much exceptions? 
It is not us! We, we are in favour of very simple things.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.240
One working time a day, a week, a month, a year, and for life. That's easy!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.320
The salary per hour, per month, etc., etc. That is basic. But they do not stop themselves from putting things, and then they say, "that's a lot."

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.100
Fair enough! If any book that is a little too big, should be torn in two ... then, take the phone book!

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.380
(Laughters)

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.880
The phone book is full of names!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.900
It's full of phone numbers, it's as big as that! Go ahead, pull half!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.740
(Laughters)

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.760
And then you will see if you can call!

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.560
(Laughters)

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.060
Remove the labor code, and you'll see then if you can organize labour!

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.140
For those who propose it have no intention to organize labour, but yields,  profits.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.080
Because in order for labour to work, you just go ask any team leader, if they beware of the guy or girl who is from the rank.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.360
And ask them if we can get people to work for 48 hours at a level of requirements and profitability as those they claim.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.840
This is not possible, ladies and gentlemen. You would kill people at work!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.300
(applause)
They will be spoiledl! They will have deads!

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.980
(applause)

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.300
500!

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.640
(applause)

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.920
565 people die on their workstations each year!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.520
And you never see one of them on TV!

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140
You do not ever see the worker who fell from the scaffolding.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.140
You do not ever see the man or the woman whose arm was cut by the machine.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.120
Never!

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.740
These deaths, are prehaps not horrible enough to edify the people in the only thing that is worth it: the fear of the other!
