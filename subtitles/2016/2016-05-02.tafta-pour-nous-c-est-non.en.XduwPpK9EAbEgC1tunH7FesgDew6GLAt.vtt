00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
Since 2009, I have desperately tried to explain that a Great Transatlantic Market was in preparation.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.260
It is a market between the USA and the EU. It has become quite commonplace now, we know what it consists in.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:21.980
Why am I the only one here who wrote that there was a project of a Great Transatlantic Market in his draft, in 2009?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.940
A few months ago, the European Parliament voted, socialists included,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.100
that indeed, there would be a great deregulated, duty-free transatlantic market,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.220
that would remove trade barriers on capitals and goods.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.880
Were you aware of that ? No, you were not!

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.260
And now they're all waking up, after they voted everytime that something had to be voted,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.760
and all of a sudden, they say it's very dangerous etc. Well they should have done that before!

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.020
Most of our fellow citizens are not aware of it.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.260
It is called the Great Transatlantic Market.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.860
You and I are all in this together.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.520
In 2015, we will all be part of the same socio-economic union with the USA,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.140
and no one ever says a word about it anywhere! 
I condemn this treaty, of course.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
Someone had a lot of common sense when he said that no one asked for it.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.800
I do not support the development of the Great Transatlantic Treaty

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.880
that will remove all custom barriers in 2015.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.540
This treaty will deteriorate the social rights of French and European workers as never before

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.440
because they will be based on the social and labor rights of the USA.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.500
Millions of jobs will be destroyed on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.680
In this common market, economic and environmental standards will be on the same level, the lowest of course, in Europe and in the USA.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.520
Let me give you a concrete example.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.760
North Americans wash their chickens with chlorine, so you'll eat chlorine-treated chicken.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.780
North Americans despise Protected Designations of Origin, and more particularly regional designations.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.760
They already devastated everything in their country, so they don't even understand what we are talking about.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.620
Tomorrow, you will drink Chablis wine from Mississippi and Champagne from Oklahoma.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.380
This is in the treaty!

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.900
We need to implement solidarity-based protectionism,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.540
which means we won't allow some goods to enter the country because we are capable of producing them.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.680
It is more rational to produce them by ourselves rather than import them from the other side of the planet..

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.140
Until now, when a dispute occurred between a big company and a country that had certain laws,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.100
the case was judged by this country's justice.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.640
But now, with this agreement, such cases will be judged by private arbitral tribunals.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.580
Arbitral tribunals modify geopolitical balances of power

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:40.860
since nations will lose importance compared to companies and investors, that will no longer be under the authority of common law.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040
[We have been spied on] And after that, we learned that Americans spy on us.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.960
You should stop negotiating since we the Europeans have been spied on while we were preparing our discussion papers.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.500
In January 2013, Barack Obama backed the idea,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.320
and his lapdogs showed up immediately to ask where to sign.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.840
Ftançois Hollande, the President of the Republic, never said a word about it anywhere,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.220
and now he signs an editorial column in Le Monde (newspaper) with Mr Obama

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.640
in order to say TAFTA is an opportunity, and that they should hurry because people might be scared.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.420
[Some people never talk about it] If this treaty is such a good thing, why did Mr Hollande say nothing about TAFTA during his campaign?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.940
[Mélenchon regularly talks about it] Where are our freedom and our sovereignty

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:31.360
when you never say a word about it in any assembly or any meeting,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:43.460
when month after month you've been secretly planning what you call the Great Transatlantic Market, by voting in collusion with one another?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:52.320
I solemnly commit myself to never voting any liberalization measure whatsoever, under any circumstances.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.200
On no account will I ever vote the Great Transatlantic Market with the USA.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.780
In 2017, the USA and Europe will complete their common market project.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.440
No one will ask your opinion on this treaty. No one will ask what the people thinks about it.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.080
This is why I stand as a candidate in the 2017 presidential election,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.920
because it will enable you to make a decision on the matter by voting.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.640
I absolutely condemn this agreement. I hope it will be a failure, and I will do everything I can to hinder it.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.640
Against TAFTA, the solution is Mélenchon.
