00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
Ladies and gentlemen, and for many of you, dear comrades

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.700
this day began very sadly.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.160
The feeling that oppressed us when we heard the news of the death of Fidel

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.700
made us think once more that it is in the example of our heroes

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.920
that we relentlessly draw the lessons and the energy we need in order to keep paving the way

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.480
that they had began to clear in their time and place.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.740
I imagine what a surprise it must be for a lot of people to learn we're gathering tonight

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.920
to honour the memory of Fidel Castro.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.700
No sooner had he drawn his final breath

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.740
that it already looked like it had only been drawn to feed the embers

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.420
of quarrels and caricatures about him.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.040
Therefore, beyond the gate of time, if we want to be understood,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.500
and if we want that the role this man played for us all be understood,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:37.600
we need to remember that when the magnificent fire burst, lit by the attacks of our comrades

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.880
who took down Fulgencio Batista's regime

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.240
- a fire that illuminates the island [of Cuba] and gave it its destiny -

00:01:48.240 --> 00:02:02.720
the world was then divided between the socialist revolutions that every year shook

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.180
the humiliated people, the poor and the oppressed against their tyrants,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:19.160
and those who at all costs and by every imaginable mean, wanted to maintain the old world order.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:28.920
It was an age when USSR still existed.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.300
It was in this era, just a few years after, that the revolution succeeded

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.020
in China and in many other countries.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:51.660
On the other side, there were the USA and their racial discrimination,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:00.680
a great power that subjugated all the countries and peoples of Latin America.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.600
Such was the meaning of the Cuban revolution.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:13.660
Such was the message of enthusiasm and mobilization it brought to the peoples.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.880
Then time passed.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:27.000
How many events that changed the planet occured so many times during the life of Fidel?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.180
And for all these years, there was this never-ending embargo,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.700
which first concerned 20% of the Cuban economy, since the Russians took care of the 80% left.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.040
Then after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Cuba was almost completely isolated.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.100
It had almost nothing left but the strength of its people

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.680
and a mobilization that was not induced by any coercion,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.920
but by the will of millions of people who mobilized to make Cuba an independent country.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:20.180
Cuba, the Cuban people and Fidel defeated resignation.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.400
How could we forget...

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.280
How could we forget that during every fight we led,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.580
whether in victory or defeat - so many defeats! -

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.960
it was to Cuba that the tortured, the imprisoned, the defeated came to regain their strength,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.220
to receive medical care after Cuba already helped them in all possible ways.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.240
This is the way we remember Fidel and Cuba!

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.920
This little island in the Caribbean

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.020
that so many "high-minded people" judge by comparing it to Switzerland or to France,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.960
demanding the regime to reach objectives we're not even capable of attaining anymore

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.800
with the poor, the deprived and the  homeless.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.100
Cuba, so small.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.960
Cuba, so surrounded.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.000
Cuba, always here first when Fidel called.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.960
Everytime there's an earthquake, a hurricane, a tornado

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.880
Who are the first to help ? The Cuban doctors! Always!

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:59.800
Cuba, still loyal when the democratic wave reached Latin America, feeding the Bolivarian revolution,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:10.180
the citizens' revolution of Ecuador, Lula, Mujica, Kirchner, so many people.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.940
Where does the fire come from if not from Cuba's heart and spirit ?

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.900
When the time came, who were the first to help us ?

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.360
Who did miracles if not the Cubans ?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:45.360
Who gave their life and their sight back to more than 100,000 people in Venezuela,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.340
people nobody cared about before Chavez asked the help of the Cubans to cure the deprived.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.580
Who can forget the huge lines of Indians who crossed the Altiplano

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.800
to enter Bolivia, where Cuban doctors came in order to cure people of cataract?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.700
People that everybody had given up on before Evo Morales asked to help them.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.100
This is what Cuba is.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:25.940
And I wish that those who will be told lies about Fidel again and again

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:34.220
remember all this and understand why we are gathering here tonight,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:42.080
why we bring flowers, why we sing songs, why our hearts are broken.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.600
Making mistakes when running a country, anybody could do that.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:57.900
But surviving, keeping the fight going, remaining worthy of the mission you were entrusted with,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:10.500
despite 600 murder attempts against Fidel, well this cannot be done by anyone.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:17.620
And such is Fidel's unique greatness.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.300
When we ask Cubans about prison,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:28.220
they first tell us about Guantanamo, USA's official torture centre,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.700
which is still open eight years after Obama was elected.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:45.520
Of course, it doesn't seem to be a problem for many people that their leaders kill people here and there,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.180
or that they accept being spied by the USA.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.980
But Fidel saw the world differently. His world was one of resistance.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:04.360
And we need to tell all the people talking about this in Latin America, whether we are right or left-wingers,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.680
everyone admires Fidel and independent Cuba, because everyone knows that

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.720
Cuba helped all the fights for independance, no matter the political tendency of their governments.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.940
Fidel! Fidel!

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:36.600
¿Qué tiene Fidel, que los gringos no pueden con él? (What does Fidel have, that the US can't defeat him?)

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:48.540
Fidel! Fidel! What happened?

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.520
Did Fidel make mistakes? Sure, Fidel made mistakes.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.500
Everybody makes mistakes but everybody is not Fidel!

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.300
Fidel!

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:09.900
Here is the crowd of the oppressed and the humiliated from two continents that accompanies you in your final walk.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:19.820
They are extraordinary intellectuals, workers and peasants who were persecuted by brutal regimes in Latin America.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.800
They are from Africa, to which Cuba was also devoted.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.980
Fidel, here is the crowd that walks in the night.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.520
Here is Patrice Lumumba.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.620
Here is Thomas Sankara.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.760
Here is Salvador Allende.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:51.100
Here are the peasants, the Indians, the workers, the workers from every country.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:57.320
They look towards the horizon where you no longer are, for you walk with terrible shadows.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.460
Fidel, tomorrow was a promise as long as you were there

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.540
Fidel walks through the clouds (rhymes in French: Fidel marche au ciel).

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.460
And here is Bolivar's sword

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.640
that walks in front of him.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:20.240
Beware! Beware! Here is Bolivar's sword that walks throughout Latin America.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:27.580
Beware! Beware! Here is freedom that Fidel served that walks in front of you,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.220
And here are our steps. They may be heavy, worried and sad,

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.840
but they are the steps of those who walk toward the freedom of Humanity,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:46.540
who sometimes admit their mistakes in order to stand up and keep going further relentlessly without ever giving in!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.540
¡Gloria Fidel!
