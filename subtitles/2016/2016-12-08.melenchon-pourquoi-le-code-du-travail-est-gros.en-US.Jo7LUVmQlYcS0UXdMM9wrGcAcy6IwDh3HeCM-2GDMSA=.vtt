00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Why is the Labor code so thick ?

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.320
Let me tell you why. It's because it is full of exceptions.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.600
But who added so many exceptions ? 
Not us! We are in favor of very simple measures:

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.660
legal working hours per day, per week, per month, per year, and one legal retirement age. That's easy !

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.940
A wage per hour, per month, etc etc. That's super easy !

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.560
But they just can't stop adding exceptions, and then they say it's too much.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.680
Fair enough!

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.640
If they want to tear every book that is a little too thick in two, why don't they do it with the phone book then ?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.740
(Laughters)

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.600
The phone book is full of names!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.420
It's full of phone numbers, it's as thick as that ! Go ahead, rip half of it away!

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.280
But you'll have problems to make phone calls!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.360
Get rid of the Labor code, and you'll see if it's possible to organize labor!

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.500
Those who propose this idea have no intention to organize labor! They want to organize returns on investments and profits!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.520
Because to make labor function, just ask any staff leader if you are suspicious of a member of staff...

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.360
Ask them if people can achieve the expected requirement levels and profits if they work for 48 hours!

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.120
It's not possible, ladies and gentlemen!
It would kill people at work!

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.960
People would ruin their health!
They would die!

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.980
(applause)

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.680
500!

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.800
565 people die at their workplace each year!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.820
And you never see any of them on TV!

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.400
You never see the worker who fell from a scaffolding.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.440
You never see the man or the woman whose arms were chopped off by a machine.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.520
Never!

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.780
Maybe these deaths are not horrible enough to edify the people with the only thing that is worth it according to them:

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.000
the fear of others!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.800
