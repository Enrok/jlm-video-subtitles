00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Dear colleague, how come you are so certain

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.760
that we are in favor of immigration?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.920
This is a misunderstanding.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.780
We are opposed to forced exile, that's what this immigration is,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.040
given the current economic policies.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.340
However, we'll take note of your advices

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.340
on the best way to convey our ideas.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.520
How can you believe this? It has nothing to do with reality.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.640
How come you believe this

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.980
when we say the opposite? Immigration is forced exile,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.620
and this forced exile is the result of the economic and war policies

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.980
you have always supported in this assembly.
