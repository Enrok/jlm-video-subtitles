00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
"Gala" (tabloid magazine) respects the people they interview. They respected the rules we set.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.120
They did not invade my privacy. They accepted the rules of the game.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.880
It has a large audience.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.120
My entry point was quinoa, which was an allusion. It's a vegetarian meal - I'm trying to better myself.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.340
Journalist: You have not yet become a vegetarian , right?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.340
JLM: No I have not. By the way, I'm not teaching people a lesson, nor giving advice.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.120
I just explained how I got there - maybe people who think the same will identify with me.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.660
This is the political message I want to convey.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
The only reason I gave an interview to "Gala" was to convey a political message,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.980
and my message is that we have to reduce our consumption of meat proteins,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.460
because this consumption is a catastrophe for the environment, it ruins our economy,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.020
and above all - I did not say this intentionally - this consumption is at the expense of apalling animal suffering,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.100
which is intolerable for a society that promotes values of compassion, because animals are sentient beings.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.480
We eat meat, that's a fact, but that doesn't mean we should torment animals.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:15.120
You see how an issue that you might consider ethical or philosophical turns out to be an economic issue too:

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:24.400
we cannot accept this abominable system of 1,000-cow, or 10,000-cow, or 50,000-rabbit  or 30,000-sow farms

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.980
that produces a meat quality that most of the time...

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:38.240
- I don't mean to criticize cattle breeders that produce meat, I'm not talking about this type of breeding -

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.500
I'm talking about the meat that comes out at the end of the chain of 1,000-cow farms.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.380
This meat comes from cows that are killed after they were completely exhausted, because they produced everything they could,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.740
and huge quantities of low-quality, poisonous meat flood the market (...).

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.920
The impact of cattle breeding on greenhouse gases is more important than that of all the modes of transport.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.840
Can you believe it? This is huge! We have to take this into account.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.040
The global population will soon reach 10 billion people, so we cannot continue to live, produce and consume the way we do it today.
