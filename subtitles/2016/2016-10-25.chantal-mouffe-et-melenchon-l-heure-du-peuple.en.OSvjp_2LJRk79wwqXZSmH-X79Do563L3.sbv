0:01:11.360,0:01:16.220
Good evening everyone. Thank you for coming tonight.

0:01:18.260,0:01:25.960
This meeting has been organized by the association Mémoire des luttes (Remembering struggles)

0:01:25.960,0:01:29.080
of which I am a member, and my name is Christophe Ventura.

0:01:29.080,0:01:40.500
So we had the idea of organizing a dialogue, and I insist on this word, for it is neither a conference nor a meeting,

0:01:40.500,0:01:49.340
between Chantal Mouffe and Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

0:01:49.340,0:01:54.160
So tonight we are going to deal with political philosophy,

0:01:54.160,0:02:05.100
and the idea is to tackle different subjects that are fundamental in the work and the personal history of our guests,

0:02:05.100,0:02:13.380
but subjects that are also part of the... let us say of the constant media background noise,

0:02:13.380,0:02:16.660
and these are the people and populism.

0:02:16.660,0:02:22.220
We will wonder how to define these concepts, how to tackle and use them.

0:02:22.220,0:02:32.120
Tonight's objective is to confront the works and theories of Chantal Mouffe with those of Jean-Luc Mélenchon,

0:02:32.120,0:02:38.220
who, as the candidate of La France Insoumise in the 2017 presidential campaign,

0:02:38.220,0:02:45.180
applies some of his ideas within the framework of an election campaign.

0:02:45.180,0:02:53.200
We will therefore try to examine all these subjects tonight.

0:02:53.200,0:02:56.260
We will proceed as follows:

0:02:56.260,0:03:05.240
the evening has been organized around six topics or thematical points

0:03:05.340,0:03:12.580
that will be freely discussed by Chantal Mouffe and Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

0:03:12.580,0:03:15.660
They will have the possibility to answer each other,

0:03:15.660,0:03:22.540
to develop the points that according to them need to be clarified.

0:03:22.540,0:03:29.820
Okay, so let us start without further delay, we have two hours, so this debate should end around 9 p.m.

0:03:29.820,0:03:33.500
I hope you will enjoy this debate.

0:03:33.500,0:03:40.880
So let us start. The first topic we that we will discuss is very simple,

0:03:40.880,0:03:48.000
we often talk about the people, but is there such a thing as the people? What do we mean by the people?

0:03:48.000,0:03:59.140
Is it an effective category? Is it merely a catch-all term? Is the people a permanent category?

0:03:59.140,0:04:04.380
Is today's people the same as it was one, two or three centuries ago? Are players the same?

0:04:04.380,0:04:14.200
If not, if players are different, should we consider new ways of speaking with the people, of mobilizing the people then?

0:04:14.200,0:04:16.560
Our discussion will be concerned with these subjects.

0:04:16.560,0:04:24.120
I will now give the floor to Chantal Mouffe who is a professor in political theory.

0:04:24.120,0:04:30.000
She recently published "On the Political"?.

0:04:30.000,0:04:38.900
Of course Chantal assisted Ernesto Laclau in his research on populism and hegemony for a long time.

0:04:38.900,0:04:44.940
One of their most famous works, 'Hegemony and Socialist Strategy', was released 30 years ago.

0:04:44.940,0:04:49.800
Their work was very concerned about the Latin-American realities, Argentina particularly,

0:04:49.800,0:04:57.500
and had a significant influence on a number of intellectual or political players,

0:04:57.500,0:05:00.400
and even on political movements, as in the case of Spain.

0:05:00.400,0:05:08.560
Chantal Mouffe's work is often associated with the strategy o the Spanish movement Podemos, she will give us her opinion on that.

0:05:08.560,0:05:15.600
So Chantal Mouffe, does 'the people' exist? And what do we mean by 'the people'?

0:05:15.600,0:05:19.480
CM: What I think might be shocking, but no, 'the people' does not exist.

0:05:19.480,0:05:27.300
Let me explain. It is not an empirical reality.

0:05:27.300,0:05:30.860
JLM: You should speak in the mic.

0:05:30.860,0:05:40.660
(...)

0:05:40.660,0:05:43.400
CM: Does it work? Ok, good.

0:05:43.400,0:05:50.860
So the people is not an empirical entity. Population is an empirical entity.

0:05:50.860,0:05:58.340
The people as a political category is always a construction, a discursive construction.

0:05:58.340,0:06:07.060
Maybe I should explain what I mean, because people think that discourse is only a linguistic category.

0:06:07.060,0:06:11.520
In "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy", the book Ernesto Laclau and I wrote,

0:06:11.520,0:06:18.760
we explain what we mean by the category of discourse, and we say that society is always a discursive space.

0:06:18.760,0:06:26.080
But we use the term discourse to refer to a set of practices.

0:06:26.120,0:06:30.800
I insist on that, because discourse is usually considered to be an idealist position but it's not.

0:06:30.800,0:06:36.540
The people is something that is built through a series of practices, of discourses

0:06:36.540,0:06:41.240
and of what I consider a very important element, affects. I will  develop this idea later on.

0:06:41.240,0:06:43.800
The people is always a construction.

0:06:43.800,0:06:51.520
Maybe we should highlight something that is important for understanding the way the people builds itself.

0:06:51.520,0:06:58.560
This depends on how we conceive politics. As I said, the people is a political category.

0:06:58.560,0:07:04.600
Our way of conceiving politics decides our way of conceiveing how the people builds itself.

0:07:04.600,0:07:07.660
All things considered, there are two fundamental ways of conceiving politics.

0:07:07.660,0:07:12.280
There is what we call the associative conception and the dissociative conception.

0:07:12.280,0:07:21.760
The associative conception see politics as an area of freedom where we can all meet, cooperate and come to an agreement.

0:07:21.760,0:07:32.980
The dissociative conception also believes in cooperation, but within a society that is necessarily made of antagonisms.

0:07:32.980,0:07:38.680
In this conception, antagonisms and conflicts are the essence of politics,

0:07:38.680,0:07:42.760
because if antagonisms and conflicts did not exist, politics would be unnecessary.

0:07:42.760,0:07:49.540
It is very important to understand this first, and of course I share the dissociative conception.

0:07:49.540,0:08:01.020
I support the idea that in building itself, the people creates a collective identity, a 'we',

0:08:01.020,0:08:03.500
but  to do so, it has to determine a 'they'.

0:08:03.500,0:08:10.920
In this conception, antagonisms are inherent to society.

0:08:10.920,0:08:18.760
As a matter of fact, I share a conception of politics that goes back to Machiavelli.

0:08:18.760,0:08:26.720
Machiavelli said that every society was made of a fundamental conflict between two 'umori'.

0:08:26.720,0:08:31.600
On the one hand, there are the 'grandi', those who have power, today's oligarchy,

0:08:31.600,0:08:34.800
and on the other hand, there is the 'popolo', the basis, that defends itself.

0:08:34.800,0:08:37.940
According to hil, this is something that exists in every society.

0:08:37.940,0:08:45.680
It is important to understand that society is necessarily divided to understand what I will develop later on.

0:08:45.680,0:08:51.040
Society is divided, political identities are always collective constructions,

0:08:51.040,0:08:56.660
and politics is about determining a 'we' and a 'they'.

0:08:56.740,0:09:01.440
Politics is always about chosing one side or another.

0:09:01.600,0:09:04.640
When we try to understand how the people builds itself,

0:09:04.640,0:09:11.160
we can always see different constructions competing with one another.

0:09:11.160,0:09:21.460
What makes a difference between them is the way to build the 'we' and the 'they' that are opposed.

0:09:21.460,0:09:29.380
Another issue concerns the relationship between the 'we' and the 'they'.

0:09:29.380,0:09:36.800
When we talk about the people, we always have to think about what kind of people we want to build,

0:09:36.800,0:09:40.480
and what kind of 'they' this people will be opposed to.

0:09:40.480,0:09:44.580
(...)

0:09:50.000,0:09:58.140
JLM: Chantal just set the stage for an idea that I take up, that of the people building itself as a subjective category,

0:09:58.140,0:10:03.000
defining itself as a 'we', as opposed to 'they',

0:10:03.000,0:10:06.760
and as far as I am concerned, the people versus oligarchy.

0:10:06.760,0:10:14.860
But I belong to the philosophical tradition of historical materialism, and as a consequence,

0:10:14.860,0:10:26.780
in developing the theory of the citizens' revolution, I primarily focused on the people as a physical or material reality.

0:10:26.780,0:10:32.880
I asked myself where it came from, what it was and how I could name it, as you did.

0:10:32.880,0:10:37.660
Of course, I integrated the idea that this reality was the result of history.

0:10:37.660,0:10:47.800
What we called 'the people' in the 18th century or during the French Revolution has nothing to do with what we call 'the people' today.

0:10:47.800,0:10:56.660
Why? Because an event occured, and I'll come back to it, but I want to add that in my book "The Age of the People",

0:10:56.660,0:11:01.900
I gave a positive definition of the people, meaning I did not define it in relation to the old way of conceiving the people,

0:11:01.900,0:11:04.400
rather, I gave my own definition.

0:11:04.400,0:11:08.760
In the first words of the book, I used a quotation from "One Hundred Years of Solitude" by Garcia Màrquez,

0:11:08.820,0:11:15.800
when Colonel Aureliano Buendia remembers the past in front of the firing squad.

0:11:15.800,0:11:22.680
At this moment, he says that when he was young, this world was so recent that many things lacked names,

0:11:22.680,0:11:25.380
and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.

0:11:25.380,0:11:28.860
As a consesquence, I point at something that I call 'the people',

0:11:28.860,0:11:35.080
but your conception of the people, which is always unclear, as is always the case with the term 'people',

0:11:35.080,0:11:40.080
might not correspond to what I call 'the people' as a material reality.

0:11:40.080,0:11:43.640
This is the first step for understanding my methodology.

0:11:43.640,0:11:45.640
So what happened?

0:11:45.640,0:11:54.760
I belong to a historical tradition that conceives history as the history of class struggle for the appropriation of wealth.

0:11:54.760,0:11:59.860
This is the starting point of the basic lateralization that Chantal speaks of,

0:11:59.860,0:12:06.480
between the proletarian and the bourgeois, between those who own the means of production and their subordinates.

0:12:06.480,0:12:13.880
It is this contradiction that gives birth to the political field, along with its fundamental meaning. They are rooted in material reality.

0:12:13.880,0:12:20.000
So what happened? (according to me at least, I answer the question from the angle you tackled it)

0:12:20.000,0:12:27.800
I figured out that previous to the possibility of class struggle, another phenomenon had to occur,

0:12:27.820,0:12:29.920
and this phenomenon is quantity.

0:12:29.920,0:12:35.920
By this I mean that a certain quantity of human beings producing their livelihood  is necessary

0:12:35.920,0:12:40.100
before some of them begin to appropriate a part of what the  rest produced.

0:12:40.100,0:12:46.560
As a consequence, I came to the conclusion that history is the result of the fluctuation of the quantity of human beings,

0:12:46.560,0:12:53.000
as are class struggle and the rest of the conflicts that oppose human beings.

0:12:53.000,0:12:57.860
If need be, I can develop this idea, although I don't want to start a conference,

0:12:57.860,0:13:01.960
but there is a very close connection between the quantity of human beings

0:13:01.960,0:13:05.420
and the development of science and technologies in such and such era.

0:13:05.420,0:13:07.280
This can be demonstrated if we use the opposite example:

0:13:07.280,0:13:12.360
when the quantity of human beings dicreases in a society, when this society isolates itself from the rest of human beings,

0:13:12.360,0:13:15.620
it goes through a decline, not only in the number of tools it uses,

0:13:15.620,0:13:18.920
but also in the quality of their design and the scientific requirements needed to obtain these tools.

0:13:18.920,0:13:25.400
The connection does exist, but it was unvisible in the beginning of the history of humanity,

0:13:25.400,0:13:28.080
because humanity began with small groups.

0:13:28.080,0:13:32.440
We had to wait for the year 1800 to reach the first billion of human beings,

0:13:32.440,0:13:37.600
and since then, the quantity of human beings has increased in a breathtaking way.

0:13:37.600,0:13:41.480
I was born at a time when the global population was 2.3 billion,

0:13:41.480,0:13:44.040
whereas there are 7 billions of human beings today, and there will be 10 very soon.

0:13:44.040,0:13:51.400
Therefore, this huge quantity of human beings modifies itself precisely because of its quantity,

0:13:51.400,0:13:56.180
because it becomes urbanized, 80% of the global population is urbanized,

0:13:56.180,0:14:00.560
and because its composition diversifies as it grows.

0:14:00.560,0:14:05.180
Contrary to what one might think, the more population grows, the more individuals are unique.

0:14:05.180,0:14:08.440
So the increase in quantity singles out human beings

0:14:08.440,0:14:12.880
and enables individuals to become the players of their own history.

0:14:12.880,0:14:18.900
My third point is that everyone is part of, lives inside and through networks.

0:14:18.900,0:14:27.440
I am not only talking about social networks, but also about electricity and gas networks, about roads, buildings and all these things.

0:14:27.440,0:14:32.060
The proletariat can be considered the first organized social network

0:14:32.060,0:14:35.340
because of its size, its mass and the organization of its housing.

0:14:35.340,0:14:42.900
But what I call 'the people' today is this huge urban population, that is interdependent,

0:14:42.900,0:14:52.060
spatially organized according to social hierarchies that result from the distribution of wealth in society.

0:14:52.060,0:14:56.500
Does the people manifest itself materially and physically in a revolutionary process?

0:14:56.500,0:14:59.440
As I belong to the tradition of materialism, I am particularly interested in this issue.

0:14:59.440,0:15:03.560
Well the answer is yes, in a revolutionary process, the people manifests itselfs materially.

0:15:03.560,0:15:11.540
This can be observed nowadays thanks to those communication tools we call smartphones.

0:15:11.540,0:15:17.300
Once again, contrary to what one might think, we massively communicate because of proximity, not because of distance.

0:15:17.300,0:15:22.480
Communication is more intense within urban areas than within rural areas, or from rural to urban areas,

0:15:22.480,0:15:29.340
and one of the characteristics of revolutionary periods is the intensification of communication networks.

0:15:29.420,0:15:34.200
Here we have the material demonstration of an old phrase uttered by Leon Trotsky.

0:15:34.200,0:15:37.840
He said that when the people, no sorry, he did not use that word,

0:15:37.940,0:15:40.740
when the proletariat or society begin a revolution,

0:15:40.740,0:15:46.780
social temperature increases and information circulates more quickly.

0:15:46.880,0:15:50.400
This is precisely what happens, in a presidential election for instance,

0:15:50.400,0:15:55.220
in the beginning of a campaign, a piece of information needs a month to circulate among the population,

0:15:55.220,0:16:00.820
whereas two or three days before the vote, any piece of information is transmitted all around the country in less than an hour,

0:16:00.820,0:16:02.820
because everyone is impassioned.

0:16:02.820,0:16:07.720
To summarize, today's people is not the people of the 18th or the 19th century.

0:16:07.720,0:16:15.980
What I call 'the people' is the networked Homo Urbanus, and I describe it in two conditions:

0:16:15.980,0:16:21.260
First, its initial form, that Marxism described as...

0:16:21.260,0:16:24.500
Marxism used to talk about the working class in itself,

0:16:24.500,0:16:28.040
meaning the working class defined by its position in social relations.

0:16:28.040,0:16:31.240
Marx used a phrase that may sound like a magic formula,

0:16:31.240,0:16:34.340
or the phrase of an idealist in the philosophical sense, since we are  criticized for being idealists,

0:16:34.340,0:16:37.340
He said "The proletariat is revolutionary or it is nothing".

0:16:37.340,0:16:43.300
If we give it some thought, how could the proletariat, a real and material category, described by a model of social relations,

0:16:43.300,0:16:47.200
how could it cease to exist if it is not conscious of its own existence.

0:16:47.200,0:16:51.520
I describe the people in the same way.

0:16:51.660,0:16:56.920
There is the people in itself, meaning the multitude or population, as Chantal Mouffe just said.

0:16:56.920,0:17:00.300
CM: The multitude is a different concept.

0:17:00.400,0:17:01.980
JLM: Yes I know that...

0:17:01.980,0:17:08.880
CM: We should not mix concepts, because the concept of the multitude is used by many theorists,

0:17:08.880,0:17:12.960
like antonio Negri for instance, it's important to make a difference between them.

0:17:12.960,0:17:18.700
I agree that there is a distinction between the proletariat and the people,

0:17:18.740,0:17:22.680
but to me, the multitude is something different.

0:17:22.680,0:17:27.680
I think it is important to clarify categories.

0:17:27.680,0:17:32.880
When I think about... I mean...

0:17:32.880,0:17:38.360
I'm interested in understanding how the people builds itself politically today.

0:17:38.360,0:17:41.100
Something important is at stake here.

0:17:41.400,0:17:48.660
First, as you said, it is true that some still talk about the proletariat,

0:17:48.660,0:17:51.120
whereas some prefer the category of the people.

0:17:51.120,0:17:54.980
I think this choice has important consequences.

0:17:54.980,0:18:04.240
Given the recent transformations of capitalism, we can no longer use terms or concepts that

0:18:04.240,0:18:09.220
were pertinent in the past but that are...

0:18:09.220,0:18:14.100
Maybe we will discuss this later on, are we not?

0:18:14.100,0:18:22.800
How...? I don't want to rush because I think we will discuss this later on,

0:18:22.800,0:18:28.700
but I think we also wanted to talk about the relation between the people and democracy.

0:18:28.700,0:18:31.080
Christophe Ventura: Yes, except if Jean-Luc has something to add.

0:18:31.080,0:18:33.840
JLM: I'll just finish what I was saying.

0:18:33.840,0:18:40.040
I used the word 'multitude' because I was looking for words that would not stumble against one another.

0:18:40.040,0:18:46.280
I might have used 'population', since it is a translation of the greek words 'laos', 'demos' or 'genos',

0:18:46.280,0:18:50.460
which are three ways of naming population with different characteristics.

0:18:50.460,0:18:57.240
I used 'multitude', not in the sense of Toni Negri and others, but in the sense of a crowd

0:18:57.240,0:19:02.660
heading to and fro within the city, entering or leaving the elevator, going to or coming back from work,

0:19:02.660,0:19:05.640
or having no job... CM: Yes, that's what I call 'population'.

0:19:05.640,0:19:11.700
JLM: Yes, it is probably the correct word, but it was harder for me to say the 'population becomes the people',

0:19:11.700,0:19:16.640
this was a possibility, but I prefered using 'multitude' to refer to the people in itself,

0:19:16.640,0:19:22.000
that is, thousands of people with different social conditions, different hobbies,

0:19:22.000,0:19:28.340
that become the people through a political decision described by Chantal Mouffe.

0:19:28.340,0:19:33.760
I mean, the people as a body politic is a construction, a self-construction,

0:19:33.760,0:19:37.060
that defines itself as a 'we' in opposition to 'they',

0:19:37.060,0:19:39.980
and here we share a common view.

0:19:39.980,0:19:44.880
I wanted to emphasize the materialist path that led me to your ideas.

0:19:44.880,0:19:48.400
Just one last word to make sure you understand what I'm saying.

0:19:48.400,0:19:54.620
To me, the concept of people does not erase the concepts of proletariat and salariat.

0:19:54.620,0:19:58.020
The people contains the salariat and the proletariat,

0:19:58.020,0:20:00.860
and very often, the latter plays a role within the people

0:20:00.860,0:20:03.360
that helps the people to become aware of the 'we'.

0:20:03.360,0:20:06.600
Let me cite a concrete example taken from a revolutionary period,

0:20:06.600,0:20:14.360
that of the General Union of Tunisian Workers, that played a role in the revolutionary process in Tunisia.

0:20:14.360,0:20:20.480
In each district, the union explained to people how to organize a neighboorhood committee,

0:20:20.480,0:20:24.380
because only the union had experienced the self-organization of masses.

0:20:24.380,0:20:26.900
But compared to a factory committee,

0:20:26.900,0:20:32.480
organizing a neighboorhood committee at the onset of a revolutionary process is a completely different story.

0:20:32.480,0:20:36.140
At the risk of talking too much, let me cite the opposite example,

0:20:36.140,0:20:41.460
when there were demonstrations in Brasil against the building of facilities for the Football World Cup,

0:20:41.460,0:20:47.920
people surged into the streets. It looked like a demonstration against the government,

0:20:47.920,0:20:51.620
but some friends said no, this is a left-wing demonstration,

0:20:51.620,0:20:56.540
so we asked a friend, one of the leaders of the Landless Workers' Movement,

0:20:56.540,0:20:59.880
why he considered this demonstration  against the government a left -wing demonstration.

0:20:59.880,0:21:04.880
He almost felt compelled to say that it was because petitions also circulated within factories,

0:21:04.920,0:21:08.260
but he did not think for a minute that it was a left demonstration

0:21:08.260,0:21:11.560
precisely because the people was in the street to assert its sovereignty.

0:21:11.560,0:21:16.380
This is our money, and we don't want to build football stadiums with it, we want to build public transport.

0:21:16.380,0:21:23.420
Therefore the people becomes a body politic by asserting its own sovereignty.

0:21:23.420,0:21:30.540
So much for the concept, I just wanted to show how Chantal's ideas matched mine,

0:21:30.640,0:21:33.320
although we do not use the same words.

0:21:34.540,0:21:38.700
CM: Yes. I think we will have to discuss this at some point.

0:21:38.700,0:21:43.560
The people does not necesarily builds itself in a progressive way.

0:21:43.660,0:21:50.940
If we want to understand populism, we need to keep that in mind for later.

0:21:50.940,0:21:54.320
CV: Yes, we will discuss this later in the debate.

0:21:54.320,0:22:03.700
So, now that you defined the category of the people,

0:22:03.800,0:22:07.560
we will try to focus on another aspect.

0:22:07.560,0:22:16.740
Today, it is fashionable to say we live in post-political democracies,

0:22:16.740,0:22:21.480
democracies whose characteristic is consensus,

0:22:21.480,0:22:31.060
in which conflicts or antagonistic policies are undesirable.

0:22:31.060,0:22:35.760
So we will discuss this, and now that we defined the people,

0:22:35.760,0:22:40.520
how can we build a relation between the people and democracy?

0:22:40.520,0:22:47.140
Is the people an asset or a problem for democracy? This question might be surprising,

0:22:47.140,0:22:54.740
and yet, the media keeps on asking this question.

0:22:54.740,0:22:58.380
So let us deal with it, I'm giving the floor to Chantal.

0:22:58.380,0:23:05.280
CM: Ok, so I would like to deal with the issue of the relation between the people and democracy on a conceptual level,

0:23:05.280,0:23:09.600
because it also questions the issue of populism.

0:23:09.600,0:23:14.520
Of course, there cannot be a democracy without the people

0:23:14.520,0:23:18.640
Etymologically, what does 'democracy' mean?

0:23:18.640,0:23:24.460
It comes from 'demos' and 'cratos', that is, the power of the 'demos'

0:23:24.460,0:23:27.520
and precisely, the 'demos' means the people as a political category.

0:23:27.520,0:23:33.960
Therefore, there cannot be a democracy without the construction of a people.

0:23:36.460,0:23:46.140
Nicole Loreau pointed out something very important, 'cratos' means to have the upper hand.

0:23:46.140,0:23:59.180
Therefore, as I said earlier, 'demos-cratos' means that the people is divided,

0:23:59.180,0:24:05.540
because a part of the people has the 'cratos' over the rest.

0:24:06.960,0:24:17.020
In "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy", Ernesto and I developed the concept of hegemony.

0:24:17.020,0:24:20.840
It means that power relations are inherent to democracy,

0:24:20.840,0:24:31.680
and democracy can in no way aim at building a sort of consensus that would include everyone's opinion.

0:24:31.680,0:24:37.480
It is not at all undemocratic to recognize the existence of hegemonic positions,

0:24:37.480,0:24:42.200
or the 'cratos' of a group over the rest.

0:24:42.200,0:24:45.080
So there cannot be a democracy without a people,

0:24:45.080,0:24:48.900
which is why I insist on the fact that... some people do not like this idea,

0:24:48.900,0:24:53.380
but to me, democracy necessarily ecompasses a populist dimension

0:24:53.380,0:24:56.520
because I define populism as the construction of the people.

0:24:56.520,0:25:00.040
If we accept the idea that there cannot be a democracy without a people,

0:25:00.040,0:25:07.360
then the people always ecompasses a populist dimension.

0:25:07.360,0:25:17.160
This why I am opposed to those who affirm that populism is a pathology or a perversion of democracy.

0:25:17.160,0:25:21.080
Populism is an absolutely fundamental element of democracy.

0:25:21.080,0:25:26.940
In order to understand democracy's current situation,

0:25:26.940,0:25:38.880
it is necessary to understand that the European democratic model is very specific,

0:25:38.880,0:25:45.480
because democracy, the power of the people, consists in the act of legitimating,

0:25:45.480,0:25:51.960
that is, power comes from the people, not from God or from the prince.

0:25:51.960,0:25:56.040
This is related to what Claude Lefort called the democratic revolution.

0:25:56.040,0:26:01.020
But this democratic principle cannot stand on its own,

0:26:01.020,0:26:11.160
it always comes from a certain geographical or cultural tradition,

0:26:11.160,0:26:22.060
and our democracy, which comes from the liberal tradition, I mean liberal in the sense of political liberalism, I'll come back to that,

0:26:22.060,0:26:27.680
some call it representative democracy, others call it modern democracy,

0:26:27.680,0:26:30.900
although I prefer using the expression of pluralist democracy,

0:26:30.900,0:26:43.440
anyway what matters is that our Western democracy articulates democracy on the one hand,

0:26:43.440,0:26:49.560
which is concerned with the sovereignty of the people and the idea of equality,

0:26:49.560,0:26:52.560
and the liberal tradition on the other hand,

0:26:52.560,0:26:57.880
in the sense of political liberalism once again, which is concerned with the rule of law,

0:26:57.880,0:27:03.240
the division of powers and the defence of individual liberty.

0:27:03.240,0:27:07.380
Our democracy articulates both these traditions.

0:27:07.380,0:27:13.200
There is a fantastic little book entitled "The Life and Times of Liberal Democracy"

0:27:13.200,0:27:21.300
by the Canadian philosopher C. B. Macpherson that shows very efficiently

0:27:21.300,0:27:25.560
how this articulation between the liberal and democratic traditions

0:27:25.560,0:27:33.640
began in the 19th century, when liberals and democrats fought against absolutism together.

0:27:33.640,0:27:39.080
I insist on the fact that the relation between liberalism and democracy is not necessary,

0:27:39.080,0:27:43.860
which is why some regimes are liberal without being democratic, and some regimes are democratic without being liberal.

0:27:43.860,0:27:48.740
This may shock us, but on an ethymological level, it is perfectly possible.

0:27:48.740,0:27:56.020
If we are shocked, it is precisely because our democracy articulated both theses traditions.

0:27:56.020,0:28:00.100
For a long time, theorists in political philosophy have discussed whether

0:28:00.100,0:28:03.860
democracy and liberalism were contradictory or not.

0:28:03.860,0:28:11.140
Habermas defended the idea that both concepts went hand in hand,

0:28:11.140,0:28:15.500
whereas Carl Schmitt claimed there was a fundamental contradiction between them

0:28:15.500,0:28:19.240
and that they are mutually exclusive.

0:28:19.240,0:28:25.500
I defend a different position in "The Democratic Paradox".

0:28:25.500,0:28:37.860
It is true that the democratic and liberal traditions cannot be reconciled,

0:28:37.860,0:28:41.980
if we understand them as equality and liberty.

0:28:41.980,0:28:46.040
There will never be such thing as complete equality or liberty,

0:28:46.040,0:28:54.060
but this should not be understood as a threat to pluralist democracy.

0:28:54.060,0:29:01.860
Rather, it should be seen as a paradoxical space, as I call it,

0:29:01.860,0:29:08.280
a space that is important because it enables pluralism.

0:29:08.280,0:29:16.000
But in order to understand today's situation,

0:29:16.000,0:29:20.600
we have to recognize that the tension between the two should be resolved through negociation.

0:29:20.600,0:29:33.120
I call the tension between the defence of liberty and the defence of equality an agonistic tension.

0:29:33.120,0:29:37.860
In political terms, we could sum it up as the much touted rightwing-left wing distinction.

0:29:37.860,0:29:49.920
But in the history of democracy, there is always a moment when democratic values prevail,

0:29:50.000,0:29:52.260
in other words equality,

0:29:52.260,0:29:57.360
or on the contrary, there is always a moment when liberty prevails.

0:29:57.360,0:30:05.600
But the tension between the two is always there and there is always the possibility of rebalancing the two.

0:30:05.600,0:30:12.340
I think all the history of democracy consists in

0:30:12.340,0:30:21.160
one of these values prevailing over or being subordinate to the other one.

0:30:21.160,0:30:30.360
Now, what has been going on for about thirty years is that this agonistic tension between equality and liberty,

0:30:30.360,0:30:36.920
between the liberal and egalitarian principles, disappeared.

0:30:36.920,0:30:44.720
This happened because we live in societies where the liberal tradition,

0:30:44.720,0:30:52.520
and I mean liberal in a quite restrictive sense, which of course has been modified by neoliberalism,

0:30:52.520,0:30:57.600
has become so predominant that when you speak of popular sovereignty,

0:30:57.600,0:31:03.060
people look at you like you come from another planet, they think this concept is anachronistic and outaded.

0:31:03.060,0:31:10.200
The same goes for equality, which is why many autors say, and I agree with them,

0:31:10.200,0:31:17.800
they say that the society we live in is a post-democracy, that it still pretends to be democratic,

0:31:17.800,0:31:25.000
but that democratic institutions function without a goal.

0:31:25.000,0:31:35.540
Why? Because the values of liberty and equality that are constituents of the democratic tradition have been set aside completely.

0:31:35.540,0:31:50.280
So we live in a society in which democracy is reduced to the organization of elections

0:31:50.280,0:31:55.940
or the defence of human rights, a peculiar defence by the way,

0:31:55.940,0:31:58.560
and that's what democracy is all about nowadays.

0:31:58.560,0:32:09.160
So we live in a post-democratic society, and I think we will analyze the reasons that led us to this situation,

0:32:09.160,0:32:16.140
but I think it is very important to understand that in the course of the last thirty years

0:32:16.140,0:32:19.760
our societies went through a deep transformation.

0:32:19.760,0:32:24.960
Some call this a process of "undemocratization" or a crisis of democracy

0:32:24.960,0:32:32.320
and I think that the predominance of the liberal tradition swept away the values

0:32:32.320,0:32:38.500
of the democratic tradition, equality and popular sovereignty.

0:32:38.500,0:32:42.480
Jean-Luc, what can you say about the issue of post-democracy?

0:32:46.100,0:32:53.000
JLM: Well, my method is quite different since I am involved in a political fight.

0:32:54.080,0:32:56.080
So... Whatever.

0:32:56.480,0:33:01.720
I tackled the issue in a more anthropological way.

0:33:01.720,0:33:05.800
What is the function of democracy? This was your question, wasn't it?

0:33:05.800,0:33:09.020
So, I usually think using different terms.

0:33:09.020,0:33:14.640
My analysis is that the quantity of human beings and its fluctuation

0:33:14.640,0:33:18.480
produces a beat in history, generates contradictions

0:33:18.480,0:33:23.040
that all humans have to deal with, to control...

0:33:23.040,0:33:25.860
Humanity is full of conflicts and it has to settle them.

0:33:25.860,0:33:28.780
Where do conflicts come from?

0:33:28.780,0:33:32.380
First, one phenomenon is more important than any other,

0:33:32.380,0:33:37.540
it is the fundamental contradiction of our societies, and it is a recent phenomenon.

0:33:37.540,0:33:40.420
This contradiction is between the quantity of human beings,

0:33:40.420,0:33:42.860
the predation of humanity on nature,

0:33:42.860,0:33:48.320
and the fact that this predation destroys the ecosystem that makes human life possible.

0:33:48.320,0:33:50.880
This contradiction is the driving force of the era that just began.

0:33:50.880,0:33:56.180
I will not answer the question the way Chantal did it.

0:33:56.180,0:34:01.740
Society's development is not caused by its ideas,

0:34:01.860,0:34:03.980
it is caused by the reality society is faced with.

0:34:04.040,0:34:08.120
Now I'll go back in history.

0:34:08.120,0:34:11.440
What is the function of democracy for society?

0:34:11.440,0:34:17.260
This function is not the result of inspiration or generosity. It is the result of a very specific problem.

0:34:17.260,0:34:24.380
Contrary to what one might think, the first political communities were not organized as a large-scale family.

0:34:24.380,0:34:32.920
In the first political communities, an authority ruled the population and the territories it lived on.

0:34:32.920,0:34:37.580
Thus began society. But in this case, who decides?

0:34:37.580,0:34:43.660
The critical question for every society is: Who decides? and, Is the decision legitimate?

0:34:43.660,0:34:49.800
And in the beginning, force is the only legitimacy. I decide because I am stronger than you.

0:34:49.800,0:34:55.340
The problem is that the use of force to impose the rule of law in a growing population is exhausting.

0:34:55.340,0:35:01.660
Therefore law is decided by consenting to the violence a higher principle.

0:35:01.660,0:35:04.560
Here our ideas are similar.

0:35:04.560,0:35:07.800
For instance God decided that things were as they were,

0:35:07.800,0:35:10.620
and the power of the king comes from God.

0:35:10.620,0:35:19.280
In Spain,  it was written "Fransisco Franco, Caudillo of Spain by the Grace of God" on peseta coins,

0:35:19.280,0:35:23.200
he could not legitimate his power by saying he had won the Civil War and slaughtered the Republicans.

0:35:23.200,0:35:28.300
The power needs to be legetimate.

0:35:28.300,0:35:31.460
Where does that legitimacy come from?

0:35:31.460,0:35:39.400
Some solutions were given, and then a major political event occurred in history, the great 1789 revolution.

0:35:39.400,0:35:44.320
The words 'right' and 'left' entered the political vocabulary because of one issue, the right of veto.

0:35:44.320,0:35:47.960
Does the king have the right to exercise his veto on the laws that are adopted?

0:35:47.960,0:35:52.840
The king stood up, and asked those who supported the right of veto to stand on his right,

0:35:52.840,0:35:54.580
and those who opposed to stand on his left.

0:35:54.580,0:35:56.700
Those who denied the existence of a right of veto

0:35:56.700,0:36:02.760
presupposed that only the people's collective deliberation was legitimate.

0:36:02.760,0:36:05.700
Or rather those who were speaking in the name of the people.

0:36:05.700,0:36:08.220
The rightwing-leftwing division began on this very day.

0:36:08.220,0:36:12.860
It is therefore closely related to the fundamental issue of sovereignty.

0:36:12.860,0:36:18.200
There cannot be a democracy without the determination of a principle of sovereignty.

0:36:18.200,0:36:22.000
Who decides what? What comes within the scope of my authority?

0:36:22.000,0:36:29.580
From my materialist point of view, democracy is therefore nothing but a way of deciding.

0:36:29.580,0:36:34.840
We decide according to democratic methods. 51% of the voters prevail over the remaining 49%.

0:36:34.840,0:36:37.440
This method is absurd if you think about it,

0:36:37.440,0:36:48.860
but it means that no higher reason or structure prevails over our decision.

0:36:48.860,0:36:53.520
None! Even what we call scientific thruths, since they are true only temporarily.

0:36:53.520,0:36:58.140
Nothing is superior to collective deliberation.

0:36:58.140,0:37:02.680
If we accept this idea, the people becomes a total category,

0:37:02.680,0:37:06.920
it decides of eveything, every subject, in every circumstance.

0:37:06.920,0:37:13.380
Of course this only occurs in specific situations, in some occasions,

0:37:13.380,0:37:17.960
but this idea underpins the history of democracy.

0:37:17.960,0:37:23.100
Therefore, republicans think about what is good for everyone,

0:37:23.100,0:37:30.180
and if we go to the bottom of this idea, if no one or nothing should prevail in society,

0:37:30.180,0:37:32.280
then this society has to be egalitarian,

0:37:32.280,0:37:36.380
for equality is the only guarantee of individual freedom.

0:37:36.380,0:37:42.000
And from this deduction, Chantal's categories can operate,

0:37:42.000,0:37:46.300
with what she said about the tension between the ideas of equality and liberty.

0:37:46.300,0:37:54.260
But for us materialists, these categories come about after we answered the question of how things happened.

0:37:54.260,0:37:56.100
How do things happen? They happen as I explained.

0:37:56.100,0:38:00.000
If you really wish society to be made of free individuals,

0:38:00.000,0:38:03.700
that is, a society that is not dominated by anyone, then this society has to be egalitarian.

0:38:03.700,0:38:08.540
This is the reason why sovereigty, emancipation and republic,

0:38:08.540,0:38:13.520
I mean republic in the sense of res publica, of public affairs,

0:38:13.520,0:38:20.940
go hand in hand in the people's self-construction process.

0:38:20.940,0:38:27.120
Here, Chantal argues that the political self-construction of the people is not always progressive,

0:38:27.120,0:38:30.280
and she is perfectly right, we will deal with this issue later.

0:38:30.280,0:38:35.980
But in our opinion... Sorry in my opinion, I don't want to speak on behalf of everyone,

0:38:35.980,0:38:44.120
the method that leads to popular hegemony is collective emancipation.

0:38:44.120,0:38:50.960
Everytime the people tries to shirk the consequences of its will of collective hegemony,

0:38:50.960,0:38:57.200
the people is led to absurdities like the creation of false conflicts

0:38:57.200,0:39:01.220
such as conflicts between muslims and non-muslims,

0:39:01.220,0:39:07.940
tall and short persons, blacks and whites,

0:39:07.940,0:39:15.580
that is, subcategories that are ultimately obstacles to the initial assertion,

0:39:15.580,0:39:20.320
that of the will of democratic hegemony.

0:39:20.320,0:39:27.400
This is the way I see things.

0:39:27.560,0:39:30.480
But what I really want to stress is that the driving forces of history

0:39:30.480,0:39:32.600
are not the ideas we have about history,

0:39:32.600,0:39:36.940
the driving forces of history are the contradictions and conflicts that exist within human societies.

0:39:36.940,0:39:46.120
Here I agree with what Chantal says in "On the Political",

0:39:46.120,0:39:52.060
democracy is not possible within consensus.

0:39:52.060,0:39:59.140
Conflicts are inherent to society, and democracy aims at resolving them.

0:39:59.140,0:40:06.960
As a consequence, dissensus and conflicts are the driving forces of democracy.

0:40:06.960,0:40:10.760
There is no cost other than recognising it.

0:40:10.760,0:40:19.040
We need to recognise the existence of a conflict in society if we want to solve it rationally,

0:40:19.040,0:40:23.800
meaning we can decide to solve it democratically and not through the use of force,

0:40:23.800,0:40:26.380
we can decide whatever we want,

0:40:26.380,0:40:34.240
we can decide to vote, to use diplomacy instead of war.

0:40:34.240,0:40:39.360
As long as we deny the existence of conflicts, we will be compelled to use totalitarian practices.

0:40:39.360,0:40:43.020
For some people, conflict is something horrible and absurd,

0:40:43.020,0:40:47.760
as a disturbance of the obvious organic unity of society.

0:40:47.760,0:40:56.160
For us materialists, struggle is the mother of everything, conflict is the mother of everything.

0:40:56.160,0:40:59.660
This leads me to two conclusions, and I'll stop with this topic.

0:40:59.660,0:41:03.280
First, conflicts have an educational dimension.

0:41:03.280,0:41:09.100
So when societies build cultural hegemonies that oppose our conception,

0:41:09.100,0:41:11.100
this has been the case for twenty years,

0:41:11.100,0:41:14.060
with the hegemony of competitiveness,

0:41:14.060,0:41:18.400
or this absurd idea of the equality of opportunity.

0:41:18.400,0:41:25.460
The equality of opportunity can be fully fulfilled only in activities like lottery, not in reasonable activities.

0:41:25.460,0:41:29.340
We are going to try to dynamite all these things.

0:41:29.340,0:41:34.620
For this, we need to strike the system's weak points

0:41:34.620,0:41:38.220
in order to create a conflict that forces everyone to think things through.

0:41:38.220,0:41:44.600
Educational conflicts are a political strategy that of course contain their own resolution.

0:41:44.600,0:41:49.880
Once the conflictual event has been provoked, we have to explain how to resolve it,

0:41:49.880,0:41:53.020
but before this, you need to have the courage to provoke the conflict.

0:41:53.020,0:41:59.100
As for the bourgeois, all he dreams of is to be given the legitimate power spontaneously,

0:41:59.100,0:42:03.080
he even does nothing but repeat what others told him.

0:42:03.080,0:42:09.940
The centrality of conflicts comes from the vision we have of societies that are necessarily driven by contradictions,

0:42:09.940,0:42:12.720
and contradictions do not come from any malicious intent,

0:42:12.720,0:42:15.040
they come from the fact that we are many,

0:42:15.040,0:42:18.220
and the more we are, the more the issues of the distribution of wealth

0:42:18.220,0:42:22.360
and of the right to wellbeing become sources of conflict,

0:42:22.360,0:42:25.020
since one part of society profits from the work of the other part.

0:42:25.020,0:42:28.180
Society can only be free when it really is egalitarian.

0:42:28.180,0:42:37.300
Sorry for this addition of tautologies, but it combines the old methods of democratic socialism

0:42:37.300,0:42:47.960
with populism... Tonight I confess that populism is the issue we are dealing with,

0:42:47.960,0:42:50.500
but if I took the risk of saying...

0:42:50.500,0:42:54.620
I once told Chantal that precisely because of the reasons she gives,

0:42:54.620,0:42:57.740
I will never admit being a populist,

0:42:57.740,0:43:03.600
because this word would provoke a conflict that would be a disservice to my ideas,

0:43:03.680,0:43:06.800
because I would be constantly dealing with semantics rather than politics.

0:43:06.800,0:43:09.920
I would be forced to explain that there is such and such type of populism.

0:43:09.920,0:43:16.040
The conflictual tactics... and this concerns me more than Chantal,

0:43:16.040,0:43:19.760
brings about specific ways of organizing politically, I call it movement,

0:43:19.760,0:43:22.140
in my case the movement of La France Insoumise.

0:43:22.140,0:43:27.840
The movement goes beyond the old method of the political party.

0:43:27.840,0:43:33.240
I'm attacking the opponent from where he cannot see the conflict coming.

0:43:33.240,0:43:37.220
I am not going to use the tools and mental categories of my opponent,

0:43:37.220,0:43:42.940
thereby preventing people from becoming aware of my ideas because of a word used to blacken my reputation.

0:43:42.940,0:43:46.420
They use the word 'populism' in order to smear the radical left.

0:43:46.420,0:43:48.420
What can we do about it?

0:43:48.420,0:43:54.380
(...)

0:43:54.380,0:43:58.600
CM: Jean-Luc, you keep on saying "As a materialist"

0:43:58.600,0:44:02.500
as if you were implying that I am not a materialist.

0:44:02.500,0:44:09.500
(...)

0:44:09.500,0:44:12.160
JLM: No, that's not what I implied. I said this because of the audience.

0:44:12.160,0:44:16.240
Here are my professors in Marxism, so I had better behave myself.

0:44:16.240,0:44:19.700
CM: I also consider myself a materialist.

0:44:19.700,0:44:28.420
I'm glad because although we tackle subjects differently, our conclusions are similar.

0:44:28.420,0:44:32.340
I think we have to emphasize the fact that to us,

0:44:32.340,0:44:38.700
democracy does not consist in reaching a total consensus,

0:44:38.700,0:44:43.520
but rather in organizing dissensus.

0:44:43.520,0:44:46.960
Marcel Mauss had a wonderful expression.

0:44:46.960,0:44:53.100
He said that democracy enabled people to have different opinions without slaughtering themselves.

0:44:53.100,0:44:55.780
This is a very important idea.

0:44:55.780,0:44:59.980
The expression of different opinion without a slaughter.

0:44:59.980,0:45:06.340
In my works, I insist on making a distinction between an enemy and an opponent.

0:45:06.340,0:45:10.780
It is not acceptable to see the relation between 'we' and 'they'

0:45:10.780,0:45:18.120
as a relation between friends and enemies in a democracy,

0:45:18.120,0:45:22.140
otherwise we would consider the opponent as someone to eliminate.

0:45:22.140,0:45:28.340
But democracy can be defined as an agonistic struggle.

0:45:28.340,0:45:33.300
It consists in admitting that antagonisms are part of society.

0:45:33.300,0:45:39.300
An antagonism is a conflict that cannot be resolved rationally,

0:45:39.300,0:45:46.860
but still players try to resolve it without slaughtering themselves,

0:45:46.860,0:45:52.620
meaning they recognise that others are legitimate in defending their point of view.

0:45:52.620,0:46:02.880
It is precisely this dimension that disappeared in post-democracy,

0:46:02.880,0:46:10.740
and I think we should restore this agonisitic dimension today.

0:46:10.740,0:46:18.020
Maybe we could move on to the third point

0:46:18.020,0:46:25.900
in order to analyze the reasons that led us to this situation.

0:46:25.900,0:46:32.440
CV: Exactly. It is clear that Jean-Luc and Chantal

0:46:32.440,0:46:36.600
were able to carefully examine this dimension in their intellectual journey,

0:46:36.600,0:46:41.880
and Jean-Luc even fought against it when he was a member of the Socialist Party.

0:46:41.880,0:46:49.760
For the last thirty years, we 've been witnessing that post-democracy made its way in Europe

0:46:49.760,0:46:56.060
and resulted in the connection or merger between social democracy and conservative parties.

0:46:56.060,0:47:03.380
Their conceptions standardized, and this political consensus has become the undebatable norm.

0:47:03.380,0:47:07.280
This was theorized by Tony Blair's third way for instance,

0:47:07.280,0:47:15.420
and this way of looking at politics in fact led to the decay of democracy and to the emergence of the worst political solutions

0:47:15.440,0:47:19.780
since Chantal considers that the connection between social democracy and conservatives

0:47:19.780,0:47:30.440
led to the considerable develoment of parties like the austrian FPO or the French Nationl Front.

0:47:30.440,0:47:34.920
So we will keep on discussing the issues of democracy and post-democracy

0:47:34.920,0:47:37.740
and we will wonder how we got here, how things happened,

0:47:37.740,0:47:42.760
and what are according to you the solutions to remedy this situation.

0:47:42.760,0:47:50.000
CM: I suggest that we deal with both issues separately.

0:47:50.000,0:47:54.140
There is a lot to say on how we got to this situation, and then we'll deal with solutions.

0:47:54.140,0:47:57.520
How did we get to this situation? To me the answer is very simple,

0:47:57.520,0:48:00.600
it is the consequence of the hegemony of neoliberalism.

0:48:00.600,0:48:06.360
Post-democracy has developed in the last thirty years ago,

0:48:06.360,0:48:16.060
on two different levels.

0:48:16.060,0:48:21.680
On a political level, there's a phenomenon that I call post-politics,

0:48:21.680,0:48:26.340
it is one of the main subjects of my book "On the Political",

0:48:26.340,0:48:30.320
and it is roughly the same as Tony Blair's third way.

0:48:30.320,0:48:36.180
It is at this period that things began,

0:48:36.180,0:48:40.580
you know, the idea that antagonisms were obsolete.

0:48:40.580,0:48:45.680
Tony Blair used to say that we are all part of the middle class, so we should all be able to come to an agreement.

0:48:45.680,0:48:51.020
This was said to be a major advance for democracy,

0:48:51.020,0:48:56.000
since democracy was now mature, antagonisms had disappeared,

0:48:56.000,0:49:03.500
political conflicts between right and left were over.

0:49:03.500,0:49:11.400
Tony Giddens, who inspired Blair, wrote a book entitled "Beyond Left and Right",

0:49:11.400,0:49:17.300
a title that sums up post-politics very well.

0:49:17.300,0:49:27.600
In more concrete terms, it was then that social democracy began describing itself as centre-left,

0:49:27.600,0:49:31.720
they were no longer the left, they were now the centre-left.

0:49:31.720,0:49:37.780
All things considered, the centre-left and the centre-right agreed

0:49:37.780,0:49:42.200
that there was no alternative to global neoliberalism.

0:49:42.200,0:49:45.960
I think this idea is at the heart of post-democracy.

0:49:45.960,0:49:52.320
This means that when social democrats come to power,

0:49:52.320,0:50:07.460
all they can do is handle the situation in a slightly more human and redistributive way.

0:50:07.460,0:50:10.920
Here I am speaking of Great-Britain more specifically.

0:50:10.920,0:50:18.060
When Blair came to power, he did not try to challenge the thatcherian hegemony  for a minute.

0:50:18.060,0:50:24.620
He merely chose to handle the situation in a slightly more positive way.

0:50:24.620,0:50:32.200
Here, we need to understand that

0:50:32.200,0:50:38.780
when citizens vote, they have no choice,

0:50:38.780,0:50:43.580
since there is no significant difference between the centre-left and the centre-right.

0:50:43.580,0:50:52.000
As Jean-Luc said, the idea of popular sovereignty is that citizens can decide,

0:50:52.000,0:50:59.220
and if political programmes are basically the same, you don't have the possibility to decide.

0:50:59.220,0:51:03.620
The Spanish Indignados had a wonderful formula,

0:51:03.620,0:51:05.620
they said "Tenemos voto, pero no tenemos voz",

0:51:05.620,0:51:08.960
which means that we have votes, but we don't have a voice.

0:51:08.960,0:51:15.060
This is obvious, if you can vote for programmes that are almost identical, then you don't have a voice.

0:51:15.060,0:51:21.440
This post-politics I talk about had the effect of

0:51:21.440,0:51:28.020
erasing what was central in the idea of democracy,

0:51:28.020,0:51:36.120
the idea that citizens have the possibility of making a choice when they vote.

0:51:36.120,0:51:38.240
So this was the political dimension.

0:51:38.240,0:51:45.200
On the economic level, the neoliberal hegemony also brought about very deep transformations.

0:51:45.200,0:51:49.440
I don't have time to go into details,

0:51:49.440,0:51:53.780
but I call 'oligarchization' the phenomenon that occured in our societies.

0:51:53.780,0:52:04.160
It means that inequalities increased exponentially because of the globalization of economy and finance.

0:52:04.160,0:52:06.960
Thomas Piketty's works are very clear on this point.

0:52:06.960,0:52:18.100
To me, this phenomenon is really specific to neoliberal policies.

0:52:18.100,0:52:27.320
A real abyss now divides the societies we live in,

0:52:27.320,0:52:31.500
with a tiny group that gets richer and richer on the one hand,

0:52:31.500,0:52:35.360
and of course the lower classes on the other hand,

0:52:35.360,0:52:41.420
but also the middle classes, who go through a process of pauperization and casualization.

0:52:41.420,0:52:44.760
This has important consequences that we will analyze later,

0:52:44.760,0:52:53.540
but it enables us to think about building the people in a different way.

0:52:53.540,0:52:59.560
Both these phenomena, post-politics on the one hand,

0:52:59.560,0:53:04.860
that is the impossibility for citizens to have a voice,

0:53:04.860,0:53:10.520
and oligarchization on the other hand,

0:53:10.520,0:53:15.380
are really the end of the idea of equality.

0:53:15.380,0:53:20.300
By the way, to go back to Grate-Britain...

0:53:20.300,0:53:25.960
Of course things are changing thanks to Jeremy Corbyn, thankfully,

0:53:25.960,0:53:31.520
but the Labour Party did not use the word 'equality', never.

0:53:31.520,0:53:38.780
They talked about 'choice', they wanted to allow voters to choose,

0:53:38.780,0:53:43.280
to choose their school, their doctor...

0:53:43.320,0:53:51.900
But the very idea of equality was considered a zombie category, speaking of equality did not make any sense anymore.

0:53:51.900,0:53:56.140
That's what post-democracy is all about,

0:53:56.140,0:54:04.920
because equality and popular soveignty are central elements for democracy,

0:54:04.920,0:54:10.560
and today, these values are precisely those that were abandoned

0:54:10.560,0:54:21.040
because of the domination of the idea of liberty in the neoliberal sense.

0:54:21.040,0:54:23.860
So...

0:54:23.860,0:54:30.180
I think we'll discuss this later,

0:54:30.180,0:54:37.520
but I think that these phenomena paved the way for the development of rightwing populism.

0:54:37.520,0:54:42.380
But more generally, I would say that today,

0:54:42.380,0:54:45.840
and maybe some will disagree,

0:54:45.840,0:54:48.300
we are currently in a populist moment.

0:54:48.300,0:54:50.520
What do I mean by this?

0:54:50.520,0:55:06.000
The populist moment is characterized by the need to rebalance the relation that I said was central for pluralist democracy,

0:55:06.000,0:55:09.100
the relation between liberty and equality.

0:55:09.100,0:55:15.160
It is important that a movement rebalances this relation,

0:55:15.160,0:55:22.860
reopens the possibility of the agonistic struggle between right and left,

0:55:22.860,0:55:26.080
puts an end to center-left and center-right,

0:55:26.180,0:55:33.340
and puts an end to this consensus that reduces politics to something only experts could deal with.

0:55:33.340,0:55:38.160
If we accept that there cannot be an alternative to neoliberal globalisation,

0:55:38.160,0:55:46.140
it means that political decisions concerning the organization of society are no longer possible.

0:55:46.140,0:55:48.300
All this is gone.

0:55:48.300,0:55:55.140
In this regard, political issues are reduced to technical issues,

0:55:55.140,0:56:02.000
issues that concern the organization of a situation that cannot be modified.

0:56:02.000,0:56:10.680
And if political issues are nothing but technical issues, then only experts can solve them.

0:56:10.680,0:56:19.540
Here once again, citizens are prevented from intervening in public affairs, from having a voice.

0:56:19.540,0:56:29.760
This is specific to our societies today, which is why I speak of post-democracy.

0:56:29.760,0:56:33.920
CV: Jean-Luc, do you agree with this analysis?

0:56:33.920,0:56:37.720
JLM: Well it depends on which aspects.

0:56:37.720,0:56:42.560
Well, we began by asking what our solutions were.

0:56:42.580,0:56:46.220
Chantal partly answered the question, I'll use it as a transition

0:56:46.220,0:56:49.280
So what happened?

0:56:49.280,0:56:52.080
In order to answer this question,

0:56:52.080,0:56:55.840
we have to get used to the idea that everything has a history, everything is part of a movement,

0:56:55.840,0:56:59.240
and every movement is triggered by an internal contradiction.

0:56:59.240,0:57:05.860
Capitalism is a word that defines several historic realities.

0:57:05.860,0:57:13.800
18th and 19th capitalism and today's capitalism are completely different models of accumulation,

0:57:13.800,0:57:16.860
although each phase contains former phases,

0:57:16.860,0:57:19.960
integrates the contradictions of the former phase,

0:57:19.960,0:57:26.800
and often makes things worse in trying to solve them.

0:57:26.800,0:57:31.360
By definition, capitalism is an unstable system.

0:57:31.360,0:57:34.600
Since it has begun, crises multiplied,

0:57:34.600,0:57:42.540
and in the recent decades, crises occur more and more often.

0:57:42.540,0:57:47.100
In the past, crises occurred every twenty years, then every ten years,

0:57:47.100,0:57:50.720
and now we are in an age where crises occur roughly every five years,

0:57:50.720,0:57:55.400
and these are systemic crises due to the very model of accumulation.

0:57:55.400,0:57:58.880
The last crisis that occurred was that of 2008,

0:57:58.880,0:58:02.300
and the next to come will occur very soon, no one knows where it will begin,

0:58:02.300,0:58:05.400
but it will occur, there is no doubt about this.

0:58:05.400,0:58:10.140
The basic contradiction of capitalism is that it is a system of overproduction.

0:58:10.140,0:58:15.260
It keeps producing more and more for an ever-shrinking number of consumers that can absorb its productions.

0:58:15.260,0:58:21.420
I'm leaving aside the environmental issue, and the question of what and how to produce things,

0:58:21.420,0:58:25.840
but let us start from the basic contradiction of capitalism.

0:58:25.840,0:58:31.480
At each step of its develoment, capitalism aggravated the causes that were at the start of the crisis in trying to solve them.

0:58:31.480,0:58:37.440
WWI was already a crisis of overproduction and of markets' conquest,

0:58:37.440,0:58:40.360
between different sectors of capitalism.

0:58:40.360,0:58:45.680
At the outcome of this crisis, part of the global economy was out of reach for capitalism,

0:58:45.680,0:58:53.240
Russia and the rest, and after WWII, the capitalist market kept shrinking,

0:58:53.240,0:58:58.540
because more than a third of humanity lived under a regime where capitalist accumulation was not possible.

0:58:58.540,0:59:01.080
There was something else, but no capitalist accumulation.

0:59:01.080,0:59:10.400
The shrinking of the market led capitalism to a virtual economy, to virtual accumulation,

0:59:10.400,0:59:14.380
and we know when it started.

0:59:14.380,0:59:22.380
On the 15th of August 1971, the US president decided that the dollar, that was used to measure all the currencies,

0:59:22.380,0:59:29.040
no longer needed a material equivalent (gold), whereas currency is nothing but an equivalent between two material values.

0:59:29.040,0:59:36.160
Since then, the USA... You see that there is a correspondence between power and sign.

0:59:36.160,0:59:44.260
Well the USA began to print an incredible quantity of money that no one had never seen before.

0:59:44.260,0:59:48.880
Billions and billions and billions of dollars were put into circulation

0:59:48.880,0:59:53.140
without any material equivalent in North-American economy!

0:59:53.140,0:59:57.780
This worked for two reasons: firstly, every country uses this currency for trade.

0:59:57.780,1:00:01.540
Secondly, because every country had better keep this currency in their safe,

1:00:01.540,1:00:05.620
because it is protected by the first army in the world, the US army,

1:00:05.620,1:00:10.380
who has the power to defend the value of its currency, or so they think.

1:00:10.380,1:00:13.880
This is the fundamental phenomenon that explains what happens next.

1:00:13.880,1:00:20.720
This extreme accumulation enabled the emergence of an oligarchy made of very few people.

1:00:20.720,1:00:25.940
Here we agree on the emergence of this category,

1:00:25.940,1:00:29.280
which is a tiny group that possesses nearly everything,

1:00:29.280,1:00:34.660
a tiny group of financial companies that possesses all the companies in the real economy.

1:00:34.660,1:00:41.060
Financial capitalism then submits all the subdivisions of capitalism

1:00:41.060,1:00:45.460
and all human activities to the norm. of financial accumulation,

1:00:45.460,1:00:49.240
thereby turning everything into commodities, signs and equivalents.

1:00:49.240,1:00:56.920
This is what you call 'oligarchization', which is a historical process that has a consequence,

1:00:56.920,1:01:00.580
something that is very important for us political activists,

1:01:00.580,1:01:04.400
something Smouts and Badie called the  reversal of the world.

1:01:04.400,1:01:09.340
In the past, human society was inter-national.

1:01:09.340,1:01:15.460
Nations were created after the French Revolution of 1789,

1:01:15.460,1:01:21.500
and world order was determined through a contractual relation between nations.

1:01:21.500,1:01:24.800
Financial capitalism turns the world upside down.

1:01:24.800,1:01:31.700
This means that nations become the peoples' prisons while it is free to go wherever it wants, and opposes nations against one another

1:01:31.700,1:01:37.600
Therefore the reversal of democracy comes from the oligarchization process.

1:01:37.600,1:01:42.540
It is so, not only because oligarchs want it, I'll come back to that,

1:01:42.540,1:01:45.680
but because of the mechanism that produces oligarchs itself,

1:01:45.680,1:01:49.220
a mechanism that produces this huge financial bubble

1:01:49.220,1:01:54.480
that represents 4000 times the goods that are exchanged in the world each day!

1:01:54.480,1:01:57.160
These are astronomic proportions!

1:01:57.160,1:02:03.260
The banking system contains a huge number of signs without an equivalent,

1:02:03.260,1:02:06.160
and that's just the visible part that goes through banks.

1:02:06.160,1:02:09.980
You know that rules have been imposed on banks for them to take less risks.

1:02:09.980,1:02:12.940
There is also shadowbanking. Mr Juppé doesn't know what it is,

1:02:12.940,1:02:20.240
and it's a shame since it is the equivalent of a year of GDP for the all world. But he doesn't know shadowbanking...

1:02:20.240,1:02:25.640
This shows that oligarchs and their cast are not always well informed.

1:02:25.640,1:02:28.280
So, that's the way things are,

1:02:28.280,1:02:33.640
with at least two consequences.

1:02:33.640,1:02:39.020
A marxist would say that the ideas of the ruling class are the ruling ideas.

1:02:39.020,1:02:45.180
So the ruling class imposes its ideas as if they were obvious, natural,

1:02:45.180,1:02:48.700
as if they were laws of nature, period!

1:02:48.700,1:02:56.660
You may constantly find examples of this, let's say "totalitarian" desire to impose a way of looking at things.

1:02:56.660,1:03:00.640
As Mrs. Thatcher said, there is no alternative.

1:03:00.640,1:03:06.580
In a recently published handbook, some economists introduced what they considered the laws of economics,

1:03:06.580,1:03:10.820
and claimed that those who disagreed were crazy negationists,

1:03:10.960,1:03:14.500
because they refused to accept what they considered the truth.

1:03:14.500,1:03:19.560
Imposing one's ideas as natural is one of the methods for dominating society.

1:03:19.560,1:03:26.000
We as real democrats think that there is no higher truth that should rule society.

1:03:26.000,1:03:30.340
None! Only contradictions make society move.

1:03:30.340,1:03:35.160
So we have the imposed dominant ideas that make the political framework,

1:03:35.160,1:03:37.600
but there's something new.

1:03:37.600,1:03:45.200
Consent to authority is being taught in everyday life.

1:03:45.200,1:03:51.060
Our world is a globalitarian world, it has no limits.

1:03:51.060,1:03:57.740
In this world, it is impossible to think and act using other ideas than the ruling ideas of the ruling class.

1:03:57.740,1:04:02.020
These values are injected into our brains through everything we eat, use or drink.

1:04:02.020,1:04:05.040
The way we think looks like instructions for use.

1:04:05.040,1:04:10.920
Our way of life is entirely structured by commodities whose characteristics are specific.

1:04:10.920,1:04:13.280
They are perishable, disposable.

1:04:13.280,1:04:16.600
We need to constantly change them, they are always out of fashion,

1:04:16.600,1:04:21.520
and so on, I will not go into details, but they are dipped in values.

1:04:21.520,1:04:23.760
There is also a political strategy,

1:04:23.760,1:04:32.520
a strategy that consists in setting up political frameworks in which economy is not a political issue,

1:04:32.520,1:04:36.720
because it obeys the laws of nature, and we call this ordoliberalism.

1:04:36.720,1:04:41.280
The system tried this strategy in Africa,

1:04:41.280,1:04:44.400
where structural adjustment programmes were implemented for the first time.

1:04:44.400,1:04:49.040
These policies were then applied to Latin America, under the supervision of the IMF.

1:04:49.040,1:04:51.740
They destroyed Latin American societies.

1:04:51.740,1:04:56.620
Then they have been applied to Europe, in their most complete form: European treatises,

1:04:56.620,1:05:00.980
the 2005 constitutional treaty, the budgetary treaty and so on.

1:05:00.980,1:05:05.380
These are not economic treaties. These are political treaties.

1:05:05.380,1:05:10.920
They assert that financial capitalism prevails over all the aspects of life.

1:05:10.920,1:05:17.240
These treaties aim at eliminating democracy forever.

1:05:17.240,1:05:23.000
They succeeded in eliminating it, in containing it, but it must never come back!

1:05:23.000,1:05:27.980
How did they do that? First, by stealing words. They stole all the the words we used

1:05:27.980,1:05:32.340
in order to prevent us from thinking, this is an orwellian strategy.

1:05:32.340,1:05:35.460
A rightwing policy is called a leftwing policy,

1:05:35.460,1:05:40.400
war is peace, ans so on and so on.

1:05:40.400,1:05:44.100
I will not go into details. You understand that they stole the words we used,

1:05:44.100,1:05:49.480
the symbols, the tools and the symbolic representations we used,

1:05:49.480,1:05:53.180
in order to prevent us from thinking with our mental categories.

1:05:53.180,1:05:59.240
I agree with Chantal when she says we are in a populist moment.

1:05:59.240,1:06:03.140
This system is a theft of popular sovereignty.

1:06:03.140,1:06:08.780
Earlier in the debate, I said that sovereignty was the basic principle of society.

1:06:08.780,1:06:14.520
The ruler does not matter because it is sovereignty that enables social cohesion.

1:06:14.520,1:06:21.260
Because of the reversal of the world, the sovereignty of nations and peoples does not exist anymore.

1:06:21.260,1:06:23.260
There is nothing but the sovereignty of capital.

1:06:23.260,1:06:30.260
And nowadays, we witness a chemically pure manifestation of the desire to formalise this domination

1:06:30.260,1:06:33.420
with the TAFTA, the CETA, the TISA,

1:06:33.420,1:06:41.360
i.e. treaties that constitutionalize the fact that multinationals no longer obey any law.

1:06:41.360,1:06:49.960
We have the right to adopt any law, provided that they do not frustrate the investments of financial capital.

1:06:49.960,1:06:54.120
But multinationals no longer obey any law, on the ground that thay are trans-national.

1:06:54.120,1:06:57.340
No law has authority on them, besides their own authority,

1:06:57.340,1:07:04.180
in other words arbritration tribunals whose function is to settle the disputes between the rich and powerful

1:07:04.180,1:07:08.980
because they have not managed to avoid disputes between them yet.

1:07:08.980,1:07:14.160
They are subjected to the same old demons than the rest of society: contradictions and conflicts.

1:07:14.160,1:07:22.700
Capitalism is a deadly regime, it kills both the exploited and the exploiters. Everyone is constantly on the hot seat.

1:07:22.700,1:07:27.900
Even sharks do not kill their congeners as much as capitalists.

1:07:27.900,1:07:33.000
There is an old formula by Marx that says that capitalists mutually expropriate their property.

1:07:33.000,1:07:35.740
This is how the mecanism was set.

1:07:35.740,1:07:38.640
But how do social democrat parties...

1:07:38.640,1:07:46.140
I take this example because in most cases since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of USSR,

1:07:46.140,1:07:51.720
the social democrat party has been the only progressive party at the head of a government.

1:07:51.720,1:07:56.400
They call themselves 'government left', which always makes me laugh,

1:07:56.400,1:07:59.700
because they are not able to govern anyone, not even the police.

1:07:59.700,1:08:04.980
Anyway. Where does social democracy come from?

1:08:04.980,1:08:06.980
It is an outdated software.

1:08:06.980,1:08:09.940
Before we speak of hardliners and traitors...

1:08:10.140,1:08:16.180
You know, these clowns who understand and wallow in the situation like opportunists,

1:08:16.220,1:08:21.960
guys like Blair or Schröder, who are literally corrupted,

1:08:21.960,1:08:28.680
in the sense that they enthusiastically subscribe to a system but pretend they are fighting it.

1:08:28.680,1:08:37.020
Blair, Schröder, Papandreou, Zapatero and so on.

1:08:37.020,1:08:42.720
In France, which is a particular case because social democracy never existed in this country,

1:08:42.720,1:08:47.480
and if it did, it was embodied by the Communist Party,

1:08:47.480,1:08:53.720
because it was the great working-class party that negotiated social benefits with the help of a union.

1:08:53.720,1:08:59.340
This model is the model of all Northern Europe, and it disappeared.

1:08:59.340,1:09:04.980
Social democracy only functions when a union or a political party

1:09:04.980,1:09:12.540
negotiates benefits for workers with employers.

1:09:12.540,1:09:21.200
But when employers are submitted to transnational capital, social democracy cannot function. Why?

1:09:21.200,1:09:25.860
For instance, when you are a union activist in Denmark

1:09:25.860,1:09:31.140
and that your union signs an agreement with your employer, who's also a member of an employers' union,

1:09:31.140,1:09:36.380
you benefit from the agreement, that's not the way it happens in France.

1:09:36.380,1:09:41.420
In France, you benefit from the agreement whether you are a member of a union or not,

1:09:41.420,1:09:43.620
but not in Denmark, you need to be a member of a union.

1:09:43.620,1:09:51.300
Imagine what happens when the employer is not an old-style employer.

1:09:51.300,1:09:54.180
In Germany, employers are no longer old-style employers who know the local bank.

1:09:54.180,1:10:02.860
Schröder cut the link between banks and companies, by allowing banks to sell a company's actions without being overtaxed, as used to be the case.

1:10:02.860,1:10:05.060
This is a concrete measure!

1:10:05.060,1:10:09.600
You are now facing people who will not sign company agreements

1:10:09.600,1:10:15.960
because they work for hedge funds that do not want to lose money.

1:10:15.960,1:10:19.840
So they don't sign and that's it!

1:10:19.840,1:10:27.820
Although 90% of danish workers used to be under the protection of collective agreements,

1:10:27.820,1:10:30.860
only 20% of them are now protected by such agreements.

1:10:30.860,1:10:35.420
Therefore, social democracy collapsed, because its fondation collapsed.

1:10:35.420,1:10:40.080
Its fondation enblabled him to organize an antagonistic relation with employers,

1:10:40.080,1:10:44.880
but it slipped through its fingers since financial capital has become transnational

1:10:44.880,1:10:50.480
and since hedge funds and finance rule economy. That's what happened.

1:10:50.480,1:10:55.840
This is the reason why social democrats behave like that.

1:10:55.840,1:10:59.320
Since they don't know what to do anymore, they keep on doing what they've always done.

1:10:59.320,1:11:04.740
They think that  workers will pick up the crumbs of capitalism as long as it functions,

1:11:04.740,1:11:13.440
but it's over now, capitalism won't let workers pick up the crumbs as it is now completely predaceous.

1:11:13.440,1:11:23.340
CM: I agree, but it seems to me that...

1:11:23.340,1:11:28.300
The way you present the responsability of socal-democrats in this situation

1:11:28.300,1:11:32.900
gives the impression that they did not have a choice,

1:11:32.900,1:11:37.440
but I think they were in collusion with neoliberalism.

1:11:37.440,1:11:46.320
It's not just that they lost their fondation, they were completely involved in this process.

1:11:46.320,1:11:51.040
For instance, what to me was decisive was that...

1:11:51.040,1:11:57.040
When I wrote "On the Political"... Christophe said it was my most recent book.

1:11:57.040,1:12:02.100
It is my most recent book in French, because it was published ten years ago in Great-Britain.

1:12:02.100,1:12:18.680
In 2005, I still thought that maybe social democrat parties could become leftwing parties again,

1:12:18.680,1:12:28.980
but I became completely disillusioned with the way they behaved during the 2008 financial crisis.

1:12:28.980,1:12:38.800
If they had... 'If', 'if', that would have meant that they were different parties...

1:12:38.800,1:12:47.880
Anyway, until 2008, the intervention of the state was considered an abomination,

1:12:47.880,1:12:54.000
and all of a sudden, the state was called for help.

1:12:54.000,1:13:00.080
Social democrats might have done what Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the thirties...

1:13:00.080,1:13:06.940
Of course social movements played a part in this, he did not decide to do this on his own.

1:13:06.940,1:13:18.100
Powerful social movements drove him to adopt redistibutive policies through the intervention of the state.

1:13:18.100,1:13:23.420
As for social democrat parties in Europe, they did not even try to do that.

1:13:23.420,1:13:28.260
They did accept the intervention of the state, but in order to save the banks!

1:13:28.260,1:13:36.840
In this regard, I am much more severe than you are as to their responsibility in this situation.

1:13:36.840,1:13:42.980
They really had a chance to take advantage of the situation,

1:13:42.980,1:13:45.540
but they chose to save the banks,

1:13:45.540,1:13:52.460
and then they accepted all the austerity measures that had been implemented by the right.

1:13:52.460,1:14:06.240
It was then that I figured out that they would never become leftwing parties again,

1:14:06.240,1:14:09.280
because their involvement in neoliberalism had gone too far.

1:14:09.280,1:14:17.240
In fact, in many countries, austerity measures and privatization policies have been implemented by social democrats.

1:14:17.240,1:14:25.940
They were more involved in this process than you said they were,

1:14:25.940,1:14:33.580
because you said they were facing economic conditions that forced them to behave like this,

1:14:33.580,1:14:36.400
but they took an active part in this process.

1:14:36.400,1:14:42.020
JLM: My conclusion is the same as yours, but...

1:14:42.020,1:14:45.100
Maybe you are less aware of the reality of leftwing parties...

1:14:45.100,1:14:51.340
To me, the left is often intellectually lazy.

1:14:51.340,1:14:55.020
Leftists use to say things happened this way because such and such person is a traitor.

1:14:55.020,1:14:59.920
OK, so let us kill traitors and let socialism begin! Of course it doesn't happen this way!

1:14:59.920,1:15:06.240
I'm interested in understanding why intelligent, reasonable people end up taking such decisions.

1:15:06.240,1:15:08.240
I was a member of the Socialist Party for thirty years,

1:15:08.240,1:15:14.460
and I could see from within how an organization that nationalized all the banks in my country

1:15:14.460,1:15:18.640
ended up doing exactly the opposite a few decades later.

1:15:18.640,1:15:25.040
In 1981 all the banks were nationalized, but you know today's situation and who's reponsible for it.

1:15:25.040,1:15:29.040
I agree with you, but I'm interested in how it happened,

1:15:29.040,1:15:34.100
and why some people felt free to do so.

1:15:34.100,1:15:42.040
As time goes by, political parties, like any human organization, select their leaders,

1:15:42.040,1:15:45.080
we know their selection mechanisms,

1:15:45.080,1:15:47.860
and if you think that they are selected through the prestigious schools and universities

1:15:47.860,1:15:50.320
you are greatly mistaken.

1:15:50.320,1:15:56.480
Rather, the party silences dissenters

1:15:56.480,1:16:06.100
then it selects an elite by means that are sometimes very brutal.

1:16:06.100,1:16:14.560
For instance how did François Hollande win the Socialist Party's primary election, he who had been the lowest in the polls before the vote?

1:16:14.560,1:16:20.420
The leader was Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the second was Martine Aubry, and Hollande was the lowest candidate  with 3%,

1:16:20.420,1:16:23.940
then Mr Strauss-Kahn went through the misadventures you heard of,

1:16:23.940,1:16:30.980
and then the week before the vote, the lowest candidate was higher in the polls than Mrs Aubry who had been second.

1:16:30.980,1:16:36.380
Thanks to opinion polls, he was really lucky! Opinion polls tell everyone who is supposed to win.

1:16:36.380,1:16:39.700
But there are more sophisticated methods of selection.

1:16:39.700,1:16:45.200
The Young Leaders program for instance, that is supervised by the USA in order to spot the new generation of leaders.

1:16:45.200,1:16:51.100
So you are a young politician, and when you are elected, you are invited to visit the USA,

1:16:51.100,1:16:55.900
you can do whatever you want there, but then you make friends, contacts...

1:16:55.900,1:16:58.140
Young Leaders, remember this!

1:16:58.140,1:17:02.880
So there are dozens of mechanisms that I call corruption mechanisms,

1:17:02.880,1:17:08.420
but not in the sense of bribing people, although it does happen sometimes, people are bought, paid,

1:17:08.420,1:17:12.360
but it doesn't happen in the back of a room with a suitcase in hand,

1:17:12.360,1:17:15.220
people are rather kindly asked to give a conference, things like that.

1:17:15.220,1:17:19.460
For instance, how did some people try to bribe me? Of course they tried!

1:17:19.460,1:17:26.140
Some people told me: "Mr Mélenchon, we are very interested in what you say about the decolonization of New Caledonia,

1:17:26.140,1:17:30.140
we would like to help kanak tribes to assert their culture,

1:17:30.140,1:17:34.200
but we do not know to whom we should give the money. Would you take care of that?"

1:17:34.200,1:17:39.720
I have many defaults, like patriotism, so I began by saying the opposite of what I thought,

1:17:39.760,1:17:43.320
I said: "What? What decolonization? France does not have any colonies!", of course it does,

1:17:43.320,1:17:47.340
but I could not tell this man why I refused his money.

1:17:47.340,1:17:49.760
Refusing their money is a dangerous thing to do.

1:17:49.760,1:17:53.160
I said: "I don't know, they don't need anything."

1:17:53.160,1:17:56.540
And then I added: "Oh, I know, of course!

1:17:56.540,1:18:02.820
In Australia, Aborigines are very unhappy, I can give them your money if you want!"

1:18:02.820,1:18:05.600
The guy understood I was making fun of him and the story ended,

1:18:05.600,1:18:12.980
but I saw how they bribe people and how people are introduced to circles with my own eyes.

1:18:12.980,1:18:16.000
"Don't you want to give a conference?"  I saw that a hundred times!

1:18:16.000,1:18:20.880
So you arrive on Wednesday, and you are told "The conference is on Thursday! You may stay until Sunday if you want, we'll take care of everything!"

1:18:20.880,1:18:25.780
That's how it happens! Thus, a sort of... what you said about oligarchy...

1:18:25.780,1:18:29.240
The oligarchy could not make it without the help of what I call the caste.

1:18:29.240,1:18:34.240
The caste is made of a political personnel that is hired with the methods I described,

1:18:34.240,1:18:40.940
and of a mediacracy no one ever speaks of, which is the system's second skin.

1:18:40.940,1:18:46.700
Its function is to constantly stage what is obvious, and to tell people who's good and who's bad,

1:18:46.700,1:18:51.380
and above all, it uses the most important method, invisibilization.

1:18:51.380,1:18:55.940
In other words, the ideological opponent must disappear.

1:18:55.940,1:19:00.180
For instance in the USA,  Bernie Sanders was erased from the scene,

1:19:00.180,1:19:05.440
and in Europe too, with the help of zealous journalists, who said Clinton had won before the primary election was over,

1:19:05.440,1:19:10.420
this was in the newspaper "Liberation", if you consider it is a newspaper,

1:19:10.420,1:19:14.720
but no! Clinton had not won yet!

1:19:14.720,1:19:20.960
Bernie Sanders was close to win the primary election, but he had been invisibilized.

1:19:20.960,1:19:28.580
And when a politician is not invisibilized, he/she is given a political personality that does not correspond to reality,

1:19:28.580,1:19:31.940
but that forces the politician to defend himself or herself.

1:19:31.940,1:19:38.240
I know what I'm talking about, I am called a poutinian! So I constantly have to explain I have nothing to do with Poutine.

1:19:38.240,1:19:42.460
So journalists say "You see, there's a problem with Poutine, since you need to say  you have nothing to do with him!"

1:19:42.460,1:19:48.860
This is the way they invisibilize and demonize political opponents.

1:19:48.860,1:19:56.620
Therefore, as time and generations go by for social democrats,

1:19:56.620,1:20:04.400
union and political activists turn into battery-farmed chicken,

1:20:04.400,1:20:12.560
animals that not once in their life tried to look for food,

1:20:12.560,1:20:17.020
they are always battery-fed.

1:20:17.020,1:20:22.200
I say 'battery-farmed chicken' in order to show that they are completely tamed,

1:20:22.200,1:20:26.840
and it must be said that they are intelligent, cultured, they don't think they are traitors.

1:20:26.840,1:20:31.000
They don't wake up in the morning wondering "How will I betray the working class today?",

1:20:31.000,1:20:36.480
They think they profess the truth, that things have to go the way they go,

1:20:36.480,1:20:41.640
"and this Mr Mélenchon is crazy, besides he talks with Mrs Mouffe, whose ideas are dubious by the way",

1:20:41.640,1:20:46.900
and so on, to them, we are all crazy and lunatics.

1:20:46.900,1:20:59.580
CM: Jean-Luc, I think it is time for us to move on to the second part. (...)

1:20:59.580,1:21:01.280
CV: You should speak in the mic.

1:21:01.280,1:21:06.820
CM: So how did we get to this situation, what are our solutions?

1:21:06.820,1:21:18.460
CV: ...to get out of this situation. CM: To fight post-democrcay.

1:21:18.460,1:21:26.520
So I'm glad that you agree on the fact that we are in a populist moment.

1:21:26.520,1:21:37.920
By this I mean the need to rebalance the situation, to give a voice back to the people.

1:21:37.920,1:21:48.460
Now we are going to deal with a topic on which we might disagree, and some of you here might no like what I'm about to say.

1:21:48.460,1:22:01.660
I think if we want to know how to fight post-democracy... We were speaking of a populist moment,

1:22:01.660,1:22:08.680
but unfortunately, this moment has until now been that of the right.

1:22:08.680,1:22:13.240
But why should the right necessarily prevail in this moment?

1:22:13.240,1:22:23.160
When I speak of a populist moment, I speak of the need to fight post-politics and oligarchization,

1:22:23.160,1:22:29.960
and to do so, we need a popular movement.

1:22:29.960,1:22:46.340
Unfortunately, except for rare exceptions, the right has gained a lot of ground on the left.

1:22:46.340,1:22:51.380
And now comes the time when some of you might disagree.

1:22:51.380,1:23:01.200
I think the best way to prevent the right from being successful in this process,

1:23:01.200,1:23:05.980
or to nip it in the bud where it is not successful yet

1:23:05.980,1:23:19.100
we need to understand that the demands that underpin these... let's say perverted movements, are really concerned with democracy.

1:23:19.100,1:23:29.560
These movements are literally reactions against post-politics and post-democracy.

1:23:29.560,1:23:47.180
Rightwing populism comes from the fact that no progressive alternative answered these democratic demands.

1:23:47.180,1:23:53.880
It is obvious that... and this is the case in France and other countries,

1:23:53.880,1:24:06.180
that entire sectors of the lower classes were abandoned by social democrats, which is why I insist on their responsibility.

1:24:06.180,1:24:13.820
These sectors are usually those who did not benefit from globalization ,

1:24:13.820,1:24:19.680
workers who lost their jobs or that are afraid of losing it,

1:24:19.680,1:24:27.560
and all those who do not correspond to the idea of happy globalization.

1:24:27.560,1:24:39.120
And since social democrat parties, who are supposed to defend the lower classes,

1:24:39.120,1:24:46.920
don't want to hear what they are saying, because it goes against the idea that there is no alternative.

1:24:46.920,1:24:53.800
As a Belgian it's hard for me to talk about the French situation,

1:24:53.800,1:24:59.600
but it is clear that Marine Le Pen's success comes from the fact that she offers an alternative

1:24:59.600,1:25:09.500
to those who were abandoned by the Socialist Party,

1:25:09.500,1:25:13.920
she says she speaks on their behalf.

1:25:13.920,1:25:22.580
She answers these demands in a way... You were refering to that,

1:25:22.580,1:25:27.600
she gives an ethnic response to social issues.

1:25:27.600,1:25:41.000
And for workers that lost their jobs or that are afraid of losing it, to whom the Socialist Party gives no response,

1:25:41.000,1:25:47.420
saying that immigrants are the problem is efficient

1:25:47.420,1:25:57.000
if no one tells them multinationals are the cause of their problems instead of immigrants.

1:25:57.000,1:26:12.900
In a way, without a progressive alternative, theses classes are doomed to support the National Front.

1:26:12.900,1:26:21.440
To me, the worst response, and I think this method is criminal,

1:26:21.440,1:26:33.860
is to say: "Oh, these workers are racists and retarded, they don't understand globalization!",

1:26:33.860,1:26:41.040
this sort of moral condemnation is criminal,

1:26:41.040,1:26:45.500
and this happens everywhere, not just in France.

1:26:45.500,1:26:56.240
When rightwing populism emerges, social democrats have nothing to say but "Fascists are back! The far right is back!".

1:26:56.240,1:27:03.900
To me, the far right category is not pertinent, it prevents us from analyzing what's wrong.

1:27:03.900,1:27:14.720
We need to understand what is appealing in these rightwing populist parties.

1:27:14.720,1:27:22.640
This is the only way that could enable us to speak to these categories,

1:27:22.640,1:27:29.360
and to offer them another discourse, a progressive alternative that responds to their demands.

1:27:29.360,1:27:32.760
We cannot just call them racists and retarded.

1:27:32.760,1:27:46.760
To me the only way to fight rightwing populism is to develop a leftwing populism,

1:27:46.760,1:27:56.220
that is, understanding and politicizing their distress in a progressive way,

1:27:56.220,1:28:00.660
organizing their anger in a progressive way.

1:28:00.660,1:28:07.440
I am refering to three themes that come from the strategy of Podemos:

1:28:07.440,1:28:12.300
"Politizar el dolor, organizar la rabia y politizar el deseo",

1:28:12.300,1:28:17.480
which means "Politicizing suffering, organizing anger and politicizing desire".

1:28:17.480,1:28:23.660
And there's another point that we agree on, we talked about this in Buenos Aires,

1:28:23.660,1:28:33.040
what matters for offering an alternative is to understand the importance of affects in politics.

1:28:33.040,1:28:39.300
This is something that leftwing parties do not understand!

1:28:39.300,1:28:46.400
Leftwing parties are completely rationalist, they think that affects are the business of the right.

1:28:46.400,1:28:50.400
They think they have to provide people with statistics and arguments.

1:28:50.400,1:28:55.760
For instance, when I attended meetings concerning the issue of refugees,

1:28:55.760,1:29:07.080
it was said that people did not know the statistics, that there was not as many refugees as they thought,  that they didn't know the situation.

1:29:07.080,1:29:13.640
It was also said that in order to fight racism, we had to explain that science proved that races did not exist,

1:29:13.640,1:29:16.080
so how could people be racists if races did not exist.

1:29:16.080,1:29:25.360
Don't laugh, this is a very common argument of leftwing parties, they think they have to give arguments.

1:29:25.360,1:29:30.620
They think that everything that concerns affects is not of their business,

1:29:30.620,1:29:37.640
and the consequence of this is that affects are only used by rightwing populist parties.

1:29:37.640,1:29:44.120
They know how to use affects, they know how to build a people.

1:29:44.120,1:29:53.840
In order to build a 'we', we have to crystalize common affects.

1:29:53.840,1:30:01.340
It is impossible to build a 'we' with statistics.

1:30:01.340,1:30:05.160
In order to build a 'we', we need to mobilize passions.

1:30:05.160,1:30:09.780
Passions are what I mean when I speak of common affects.

1:30:09.780,1:30:16.480
It is something that drives people to create a collective identity.

1:30:16.480,1:30:21.260
This is essential for the creation of a new 'we',

1:30:21.260,1:30:36.140
and we need to admit that rightwing populist parties succeeded in building a people, a 'we',

1:30:36.140,1:30:42.060
but a 'we' that is unacceptable to us progressives,

1:30:42.060,1:30:48.280
their 'we' in fact shrinks democracy, it does not make it stronger.

1:30:48.280,1:30:53.420
This is a major difference between rightwing and leftwing populisms.

1:30:53.420,1:31:00.340
We want to bring democracy back to life

1:31:00.340,1:31:05.540
but in order to enhance it and make it stronger, not to shrink it.

1:31:05.540,1:31:10.920
Another major difference concerns equality.

1:31:10.920,1:31:19.520
As I said, the basic principles of democracy are equality and popular sovereignty,

1:31:19.520,1:31:26.500
and rightwing populist parties do offer a vision of popular sovereignty,

1:31:26.500,1:31:35.160
and this explains their success, because they give people the possibility to express themselves.

1:31:35.160,1:31:43.500
The major difference concerns equality, they want to bring popular sovereignty back to life for instance,

1:31:43.500,1:31:45.900
but only for national citizens.

1:31:45.900,1:31:58.000
One of the major challenges for leftwing populism is to give a voice back to the people,

1:31:58.000,1:32:07.520
to give popular sovereignty back to the people, along with an egaliarian dimension.

1:32:07.520,1:32:11.880
And I'll finish with an aspect that is essential to me,

1:32:11.880,1:32:16.520
this can be done only through the mobilization of passions,

1:32:16.520,1:32:20.500
we need to mobilize passions towards progressive aims,

1:32:20.500,1:32:25.480
towards values like social justice or equality.

1:32:25.480,1:32:29.380
You know, passions are elastic,

1:32:29.380,1:32:35.700
they can be directed towards goals like the shrinking of democracy

1:32:35.700,1:32:41.460
but also the enhancing of democracy.

1:32:41.460,1:32:49.960
Leftwing populism should aim at building another people,

1:32:49.960,1:33:02.520
a people that opposes the forces of neoliberal globalization, not immigrants.

1:33:02.520,1:33:08.100
This is why I think this populist movement

1:33:08.100,1:33:20.620
needs to give another response to the issue of having a voice on our society.

1:33:20.620,1:33:27.720
CV: Jean-Luc, did the National Front succeed in building a people?

1:33:27.720,1:33:32.140
JLM: I'm getting lost...

1:33:32.140,1:33:35.020
I would say that no, they did not, but also yes, they did.

1:33:35.020,1:33:39.720
Because they succeeded in creating a voters' basis but...

1:33:39.720,1:33:47.160
In order to answer the question, let me flesh out my ideas, because you do not tackle the subject the way I do it.

1:33:47.160,1:33:52.000
I don't think there is any misunderstanding when people vote for the National Front.

1:33:52.000,1:33:57.520
There is an interesting idea: people want to have control over their lives,

1:33:57.520,1:34:03.000
but they fail to identify the reasons that explain this situation

1:34:03.000,1:34:11.900
There is a common root... You speak of a populist moment, I speak of a citizens' revoltion, I'll come back to that

1:34:11.900,1:34:17.700
I'll give my own answer.

1:34:17.700,1:34:23.680
I am a political activist among other political activists, some of whom are here tonight.

1:34:23.680,1:34:28.180
Our first task is to have a clear idea of the situation

1:34:28.180,1:34:36.780
because if we want to offer a new intellectual and affective construction, we need to know what our own ideas are.

1:34:36.780,1:34:43.300
If we think that all we need to do is to recite what we have always said like automatons,

1:34:43.300,1:34:50.020
and that saying The Truth would be sufficient to smash the wall we are facing, we are mistaken.

1:34:50.020,1:34:57.300
Therefore, we need to understand what changed and what the driving forces of history are.

1:34:57.300,1:35:01.040
Why did capitalism become as it is now? What is the people?

1:35:01.040,1:35:06.660
Where does it com from? Why does the theory of the citizens' revolution is the answer to contemporary issues?

1:35:06.660,1:35:14.420
Why are we facing a major environmental catastrophe that will ask the question of solving problems together our on one's own?

1:35:14.420,1:35:18.700
This will lead us back to the basic issue of political lateralization.

1:35:18.700,1:35:23.660
We can observe that the old political lateralizatioin is a failure and prevents us from thinking.

1:35:23.660,1:35:32.620
Everyone here knows what the left and the right are, but it's not the case for the average person.

1:35:32.620,1:35:38.900
Normal people think that Mr Hollande is the left, the media keep repeating this by the way.

1:35:38.900,1:35:46.900
So how can we think about a lateralization model if the left is described as something that has nothing to do with it.

1:35:46.900,1:35:49.920
We are confronted with this ostacle that prevents us from thinking.

1:35:49.920,1:35:55.760
But our ideas, our theory, our way of thinking must be clear.

1:35:55.760,1:36:01.900
I agree with Chantal Mouffe when she says that we should create affects to present to people,

1:36:01.900,1:36:10.040
but then we cannot make three steps backwards, like "This is horrible! What the hell are you saying?

1:36:10.040,1:36:14.840
These are passions, no one can have a grip on them! We are on the side of reason!" and so on.

1:36:14.840,1:36:23.160
In this I completely agree with Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe,

1:36:23.160,1:36:28.300
The people understood as a political category is a self-construction.

1:36:28.300,1:36:32.280
What are the elements of a process of self-construction?

1:36:32.280,1:36:35.320
Ideas, affects and objectives.

1:36:35.320,1:36:37.880
Our objective is the political programme.

1:36:37.880,1:36:41.060
Affects are the aesthetization of our values.

1:36:41.060,1:36:44.300
I tried to do that in our meetings,

1:36:44.300,1:36:48.080
by reading poems, poems by Victor Hugo, there's music,

1:36:48.080,1:36:53.680
and all this has to do with our ideas, we aestheticize what we consider the values of the left,

1:36:53.680,1:36:58.340
i.e. love, tenderness, fraternity, sharing, thoughtfulness for the weakest,

1:36:58.340,1:37:03.440
yearning for equality, not as an abstract notion, but as an empirical reality.

1:37:03.440,1:37:07.100
And the third issue is the issue ofthe people's  identity.

1:37:07.100,1:37:11.580
Mrs Le Pen's says the people is white and Catholic.

1:37:11.580,1:37:14.380
CM: Yes, she builds a people...

1:37:14.380,1:37:16.380
I agree, I'll come to that. CM: This is important.

1:37:16.380,1:37:19.300
JLM: Yeah, yeah, it's important, but she's going to lose the battle anyway!

1:37:19.300,1:37:22.960
OK, but let me answer the question.

1:37:22.960,1:37:27.780
I'm not an observer, I'm a player.

1:37:27.780,1:37:32.980
I'm not supposed to explain what Mrs Le Pen is, otherwise what's the point of organizing meetings?

1:37:32.980,1:37:36.460
We have to build a people. She affirms that you are white and Christians,

1:37:36.460,1:37:38.900
I affirm that you are the children of the Enlightenment.

1:37:38.900,1:37:42.100
It did not work, so I decided to create conflictuality.

1:37:42.100,1:37:45.620
I said Robespierre embodied the Enlightenment and everyone protested.

1:37:45.620,1:37:49.020
At that point everyone thought about this issue. "Why does he talk about Robespierre and the Great Revolution?"

1:37:49.020,1:37:56.640
And we could see that the fundamental hegemony of the French people had been  deconstructed,

1:37:56.640,1:37:59.160
that is, the idea that the French people was born with the 1789 revolution,

1:37:59.160,1:38:02.840
when privileges were abolished, when equality was set,

1:38:02.840,1:38:05.680
although that's not true since women could not vote,

1:38:05.680,1:38:11.380
but anyway, the revolutionary principle of equality was asserted and became the collective identity of the French people.

1:38:11.380,1:38:15.320
All this was erased through all sorts of cultural manifestations,

1:38:15.320,1:38:19.380
staging the king, the queen, their friends and so on...

1:38:19.380,1:38:23.000
and the revolution was depicted as the horrible work of savage barbarians.

1:38:23.000,1:38:26.700
Therefore, this cultural reconstruction is one of our objectives.

1:38:26.700,1:38:29.920
If you hear me talking about the Great Revolution so much,

1:38:29.920,1:38:31.920
it's not because it is a personal obsession,

1:38:31.920,1:38:37.840
it's because it is one of the major components that enable us to build a 'we',

1:38:37.840,1:38:41.740
or you get Mrs Le Pen's cultural construction.

1:38:41.740,1:38:47.840
I totally agree with you, only awareness matters,

1:38:47.840,1:38:52.540
and awareness as a purely rational phenomenon does not exist.

1:38:52.540,1:38:55.600
Awareness is a mix of reason and affects,

1:38:55.600,1:38:59.920
therefore a battle that dismisses affects is not a real battle.

1:38:59.920,1:39:06.420
It is a deserted battlefield, in which we consider humans as rational creatures,

1:39:06.420,1:39:12.560
but reason does not exist without culture, music, poetry, love and collective signifiers.

1:39:12.560,1:39:16.400
Therefore we need heroes, we need to have a common history.

1:39:16.400,1:39:20.180
Debating is a tricky thing... Maybe you heard of this story.

1:39:20.180,1:39:24.640
I tried to integrate the 1798 Revolution into the public debate by every possible means,

1:39:24.640,1:39:30.940
and all of a sudden, Nicolas Sarkozy said our ancestors were the Gauls. What an opportunity!

1:39:30.940,1:39:36.620
I said this was an ethnic conception of France,

1:39:36.620,1:39:39.680
but I have another conception to offer, that of the 1789 Revolution.

1:39:39.680,1:39:42.980
How did the media sumarize what I said? Not what I said about the Revolution, certainly not!

1:39:42.980,1:39:47.020
Our ancestors are the sans-culottes, do you think they would use that as a headline?

1:39:47.020,1:39:51.740
Headlines said "Mélenchon Says Sarkozy Was Right About the Gauls" so I became his accomplice.

1:39:51.740,1:39:57.720
And then our own friends cut our hands right when we had a grip on somethig that could make people think

1:39:57.720,1:40:02.760
and create conflictuality about two conceptions of French history.

1:40:02.760,1:40:07.500
History is science, and politics has nothing to do with science,

1:40:07.500,1:40:10.660
and historians have rights as scientists.

1:40:10.660,1:40:14.040
But we politicians must offer a collective history.

1:40:14.040,1:40:18.940
And some leftwing opponents told me that no, their collective history was the Paris Commune,

1:40:18.940,1:40:20.940
which means that they did have a collective history.

1:40:20.940,1:40:25.820
That's precisely what Chantal said, if we cannot identify ourselves with collective myths,

1:40:25.820,1:40:28.560
we cannot build ourselves as individuals.

1:40:28.560,1:40:33.840
We do it within our family, "my grandfather did this, my grandmother did  that"

1:40:33.840,1:40:40.140
so there is a collective history, anf making it our own history is important, in France particularly

1:40:40.140,1:40:44.300
since it was here that the 1789 Revolution occurred.

1:40:44.300,1:40:47.960
Now I'll talk about the dynamics of ideas, that is of the utmost importance.

1:40:47.960,1:40:51.680
We already gave what you said much thought.

1:40:51.680,1:40:57.600
But since what matters is awareness, then let us talk about  workers who vote for the National Front,

1:40:57.600,1:40:59.600
but let us do this seriously!

1:40:59.600,1:41:02.380
That is, we have to analyze election results in each polling station.

1:41:02.380,1:41:04.600
What conclusions can we draw from this analysis?

1:41:04.600,1:41:07.960
In their vast majority, workers do not vote.

1:41:07.960,1:41:12.300
60 to 70% of them do not vote

1:41:12.300,1:41:16.260
because they think the political scene is all a scam.

1:41:16.260,1:41:21.360
As far as those who vote are concerned, they have a collective history too.

1:41:21.360,1:41:25.820
When we were at the height of our fame during the 1981 Common Programme,

1:41:25.820,1:41:31.640
80% of workers voted, 70% of which voted for us,

1:41:31.640,1:41:35.640
which means that 30% of them were stupid enough not to vote for us.

1:41:35.640,1:41:39.440
All thier friends voted for the Common Programme back then.

1:41:39.440,1:41:46.000
So what were they rooted in? Not in their social class since they worked in the same factories as the rest,

1:41:46.000,1:41:51.640
they were rooted in what Chantal described, a specific people,

1:41:51.640,1:41:56.460
that is, the anti-Communist, Catholic, reactionary people.

1:41:56.460,1:42:01.460
They shared a collective identity, and they did not dissapear since their leaders are in the public sphere

1:42:01.460,1:42:04.720
saying "You see? We were right!"

1:42:04.720,1:42:08.800
Therefore they benefited from the dynamics, they got the vote of those who hesitated,

1:42:08.800,1:42:12.820
because they are the important issue

1:42:12.820,1:42:20.240
They got the vote of those who do vote, and of course it looks like they are plenty and innumerable.

1:42:20.240,1:42:26.260
Our task is to deconstruct the ideas they believein and also to mobilize those who do not vote.

1:42:26.260,1:42:29.140
We need to convince those who do not want to vote anymore,

1:42:29.140,1:42:32.500
those who refuse to take part in the political procaess.

1:42:32.500,1:42:34.500
They do not vote, which means that they are no longer politicizedco,

1:42:34.500,1:42:41.480
and the strategic, revolutionary answer to the question of what to do is to bring the people back to life.

1:42:41.480,1:42:46.940
The populist moment that Chantal described consists in building the people as a body politic.

1:42:46.940,1:42:50.800
How shall we do that? There is one central, strategic argument

1:42:50.800,1:42:54.440
that we can state based on the social aspirations that we described,

1:42:54.440,1:42:56.140
it is the constituant assembly.

1:42:56.140,1:43:01.680
The process of the constituant assembly enables the people to define itself politically.

1:43:01.680,1:43:06.360
What rights do we think we should have? That's what a constitution is all about.

1:43:06.360,1:43:12.580
This is the conclusion we may draw from the Chavez and Correa experiences in Latin America,

1:43:12.580,1:43:19.840
and we know their limit: they were unable to go on building the people.

1:43:19.840,1:43:23.180
That is, once millions of people were no longer in extreme poverty

1:43:23.180,1:43:26.860
and now belong to the middle class, but that no cultural revolution occurred,

1:43:26.860,1:43:30.660
and that no environmental objectives were set, then they behave like average middle class people,

1:43:30.660,1:43:34.240
meaning they define themselves through ostentatious consumption.

1:43:34.240,1:43:39.320
Therefore their consumeristic demands destroyed the revolution from within,

1:43:39.320,1:43:47.040
because the point of the revolution was not to enable people to buy SUVs and go through plastic surgery!

1:43:47.040,1:43:51.880
We agree on this point.

1:43:51.880,1:43:56.680
We have a good political programme, but we need to make a global reconstruction

1:43:56.680,1:44:02.300
of the values and affects that go with it, of the words we use to names things,

1:44:02.300,1:44:05.060
and besides, we need to take the responsibility for leadership.

1:44:05.060,1:44:10.260
Those who say that the 'we' is more democratic than the 'I' are irresponsible.

1:44:10.260,1:44:13.200
When you speak on behalf of yourself, people know what to expect,

1:44:13.200,1:44:19.340
whereas if you speak on behalf of 'we', who's 'we' then? I am speaking of leaders here, not of the construction of a 'we'.

1:44:19.340,1:44:26.440
Creating a collective 'we' is possible only on the condition that we set the stage properly.

1:44:26.440,1:44:33.740
Leaders should not hide themselves behind a mask and say 'we' instead of 'I'.

1:44:33.740,1:44:36.480
Some leaders feel they have to look depressed al the time,

1:44:36.480,1:44:41.160
and then they speak on behalf of 'we', but no one knows who 'we' is, The Party, the masses maybe...

1:44:41.160,1:44:49.120
Anyway. This is necessary. Everytime a populist revolution occured it was embodied by a leader.

1:44:49.120,1:44:53.140
You can't reproach people for needing a leader and call them stupid.

1:44:53.140,1:44:57.680
It is precisely because they are not stupid that they need a leader, male or female,

1:44:57.680,1:45:00.460
as was the case in Argentina with Christina Kirchner,

1:45:00.460,1:45:04.700
or in Brazil with Dilma Rousseff.

1:45:04.700,1:45:11.560
We have to put forth all these elements in our strategy,

1:45:11.560,1:45:17.560
and as far as the people is concerned, we have to think about embodying the body politic.

1:45:17.560,1:45:23.820
How shall we proceed? The class party was as the class it represented, it had limits.

1:45:23.820,1:45:27.720
The party of the people is by definition a limitless movement.

1:45:27.720,1:45:32.020
It's not an easy thing to build, but we are trying to do it.

1:45:32.020,1:45:38.040
It is a movement, it corresponds to modernity, and modernity means that the more we are, the more unique people are.

1:45:38.040,1:45:41.440
People won't stand in rows as they used to do in the past.

1:45:41.440,1:45:48.740
Therefore, they will decide to get involved on their own, as much as they want and whenever they want.

1:45:48.740,1:45:52.680
You might not like this method and consider it is individualistic,

1:45:52.680,1:45:57.140
but that's the way it is, people will join the collective 'we' on condition that they are and feel free.

1:45:57.140,1:46:00.420
If we don't understand this, we'll have to force people, but this won't work.

1:46:00.420,1:46:05.800
This is my way of agreeing with Chantal.

1:46:05.800,1:46:11.380
What matters to us is to have theorists that enable us to understand the situation.

1:46:11.380,1:46:15.380
We cannot act, think and theorize at the same time,

1:46:15.380,1:46:20.060
although I try to, as I'm an old-style political activist,

1:46:20.060,1:46:23.400
and to me theory entails practice.

1:46:23.400,1:46:29.460
What we are building in this political campaign is not an election, I mean yes there is the election of course,

1:46:29.460,1:46:35.720
but not only, we are trying to build a people, that's what we are trying to do,

1:46:35.720,1:46:39.900
and what is at stake is whether we built a people or not at the end of the campaign.

1:46:39.900,1:46:46.280
And you can see that those who try to stop us are our opponents, who try to misrepresent us,

1:46:46.280,1:46:52.760
but even our friends try to stop us, because they can't stand that their authority be challenged by the emergence of normal people.

1:46:52.760,1:46:56.280
To conclude, how does a citizens' revolution happen?

1:46:56.280,1:47:03.060
There has to be material conditions, society must be unable to respond to people's basic aspirations,

1:47:03.060,1:47:09.420
among which ecology, for instance we don't want our kids to eat poison, well that's difficult nowadays.

1:47:09.420,1:47:13.420
Anyway, society does not respond to people's basic aspirations,

1:47:13.420,1:47:20.480
and my third point is that institutions are unable to organize conflicts and debates,

1:47:20.480,1:47:24.000
and when the whole system is blocked, it goes off after minor incidents,

1:47:24.000,1:47:26.280
which means no one can tell when it will go off.

1:47:26.280,1:47:31.480
A guy committed suicide in Tunisia because he did not want to pay taxes on the vegetables he sold on the street,

1:47:31.480,1:47:33.000
and it caused a revolution.

1:47:33.000,1:47:40.240
In Venezuela, people accepted all the austerity measures, except one, the increase in the price of bus tickets.

1:47:40.240,1:47:45.080
And here we are dealing with something Chantal talked about that is fundamental,

1:47:45.080,1:47:53.120
it is the role of the "middle classes", i.e. those who became middle classes when the revolution began.

1:47:53.120,1:47:59.180
Why? Because they thought their social status improved because of their own personal efforts, they did not care about social issues,

1:47:59.180,1:48:05.980
and all of a sudden, their personal ambition and merit was hindered by a bureaucracy that did not take them into account.

1:48:05.980,1:48:07.500
At that point they began to get involved in the revolution,

1:48:07.500,1:48:13.240
like in Argentina, with the "caceroladas", that began with a problem about savings banks,

1:48:13.240,1:48:15.960
in Venezuela, the revolution began because of the price of bus tickets,

1:48:15.960,1:48:20.580
I don't remember what caused the revolution in Ecuador, but every time it is because of a minor incident.

1:48:20.580,1:48:24.780
In France, it could have been because of the death of Rémi Fraisse,

1:48:24.780,1:48:31.520
a young man who died during a demonstration against the building of a dam,

1:48:31.520,1:48:36.580
or it could be because of the police demonstrations, and this is what Chantal was talking about,

1:48:36.580,1:48:39.920
a movement is ambiguous at the beginning,

1:48:39.920,1:48:42.220
It's impossible to know whether police demonstrations are leftwing or rightwing demonstrations,

1:48:42.220,1:48:50.700
of course, members of the National Front are involved in these demonstrations, but their demands are for the most part democratic demands.

1:48:50.700,1:48:55.760
The situation is very complicated, and a revolution can begin because of this sort of event.

1:48:55.760,1:49:00.360
You don't see policemen demonstrating in front of the President's residence everyday!

1:49:00.360,1:49:03.960
The whole country saw that it was possible to get an appointment with the President after a demonstration in front of the Elysée!

1:49:03.960,1:49:07.420
So tomorrow, butchers... everybody will do the same!

1:49:07.420,1:49:11.940
Authority disappeared. No society can function without the consent to authority.

1:49:11.940,1:49:19.000
This is a clue that the minor incident that can cause a revolution is getting nearer.

1:49:19.000,1:49:24.920
I call this incident, this moment, the "May they all go to hell moment",

1:49:24.920,1:49:28.860
meaning one day, people are furious and they say "get the hell off, all of you!",

1:49:28.860,1:49:32.940
"all of you!", and this includes union activists, don't think that lefties are spared.

1:49:32.940,1:49:37.040
In Argentina, people also blamed union activists.

1:49:37.040,1:49:41.380
"It's your fault, enough with you, get the hell off!" Everybody!

1:49:41.380,1:49:46.040
Society collapses, and then it rebuilds itself politically.

1:49:46.040,1:49:53.000
CV: Thank you, we are behind schedule, but it's normal.

1:49:53.000,1:49:57.040
I think we have extra-time to go further.

1:49:57.040,1:50:03.580
So we discussed our fifth topic, the issue of the right-left split.

1:50:03.580,1:50:18.460
It's true that populists are often criticized for erasing the right-left split,

1:50:18.460,1:50:26.400
but it is often so because critics misunderstood their approach.

1:50:26.400,1:50:37.340
We have a bit of time to go on on this subject... CM: No we don't. What time is it?

1:50:37.340,1:50:45.640
CV: We have half an hour. Ok, twenty or fifteen minutes.

1:50:45.640,1:50:55.520
CM: Yeah but.. CV: We have about half an hour... You don't want to go, right? We have twenty minutes.

1:50:55.520,1:51:01.760
CM: Ok then. But let us try to be concise.

1:51:01.760,1:51:09.920
So the right-left split is a very important issue.

1:51:09.920,1:51:19.500
My opinion on this subject is that it depends on how we define right and left.

1:51:19.500,1:51:27.920
I think that in building a populist movement, we should...

1:51:27.920,1:51:34.720
I mean I build on the works of Ernesto Laclau who said in "On Populist Reason"

1:51:34.720,1:51:44.180
that populism was the setting down of a political division opposing the bottom to the top.

1:51:44.180,1:51:52.880
This is why I insist on the fact that we cannot develop a reflection about  populism

1:51:52.880,1:51:58.300
if we understand politics as an associative project.

1:51:58.300,1:52:05.060
This does not work with populism.

1:52:05.060,1:52:13.940
Populism is a division between 'we' and 'they', it does not tolerate an associative conception of politics.

1:52:13.940,1:52:23.620
This political reflection that we are developing comes from a theoratical reflection

1:52:23.620,1:52:30.980
that Ernesto and I developed in "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy".

1:52:30.980,1:52:33.600
So populism is the construction of a political division.

1:52:33.600,1:52:37.780
This political division can be set down in different ways.

1:52:37.780,1:52:45.080
For instance, Marxism sets down a division between bourgeoisie and proletariat.

1:52:45.080,1:52:51.360
This is not the populist division.

1:52:51.360,1:52:59.260
Maybe Jean-Luc will disagree, but that's the way I see it.

1:52:59.260,1:53:12.740
It is not possible to set down a populist political division on the basis of the right-left split,

1:53:12.740,1:53:25.780
because it traditionally refers to sociological categories whose specific interests are already defined,

1:53:25.780,1:53:35.980
meaning their place within the relations of production determines their ideas. Of course this is very clear in Marxism.

1:53:35.980,1:53:48.760
There is also a social democrat division that thinks the left represents the interests of lower classes against the top of the pyramid.

1:53:48.760,1:53:52.720
In a way, these are readymade divisions.

1:53:52.720,1:54:00.800
The interests of such and such category are represented by the right or the left.

1:54:00.800,1:54:04.080
This is the traditional split.

1:54:04.080,1:54:13.300
This is not the way a populist movement sets down a division.

1:54:13.300,1:54:22.540
I think building a people is not the same as building a class.

1:54:22.540,1:54:28.580
The populist division is necessary more transversal.

1:54:28.580,1:54:37.320
In "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy", we said that the division is the setting down of a chain of equivalences

1:54:37.320,1:54:43.820
between very heterogenous demands that come from very different  places.

1:54:43.820,1:54:51.240
These demands are crystallized in a 'we',

1:54:51.240,1:54:59.700
and I agree with Jean-Luc, we need a leader to do so,

1:54:59.700,1:55:03.660
maybe we'll discuss this later at the end.

1:55:03.660,1:55:13.140
Anyway, the setting down of a populist division does not use the traditional right-left split.

1:55:13.140,1:55:18.780
This division brings together very heterogenous demands,

1:55:18.780,1:55:27.420
but it doesn't mean that we should discard the right-left split or that it is no longer relevant.

1:55:27.420,1:55:36.240
It is relevant on another level that I described earlier,

1:55:36.240,1:55:41.920
when it enables us to make a distinction between rightwing and leftwing populism.

1:55:41.920,1:55:47.180
I talk a lot about this with members of Podemos,

1:55:47.180,1:56:00.140
and they say the right and the left are not universal categories, they are specific to our societies.

1:56:00.140,1:56:10.260
And that's true. For instance, in Latin America, national-populist movements  do not usually identify with the left.

1:56:10.260,1:56:15.740
In Argentina for instance, Kirchnerism did not identify with the left.

1:56:15.740,1:56:20.240
There was what was refered to as 'la izquierda cipaya',

1:56:20.240,1:56:30.480
that is, the left that wanted to establish a model inspired by Europe.

1:56:30.480,1:56:40.440
There's always been a rivalry between this left and Kirchner's national-populism.

1:56:40.440,1:56:46.560
I often told my friends there that to me, they were the left.

1:56:46.560,1:56:50.680
I think the situation of Correa's Ecuador is similar,

1:56:50.680,1:56:57.560
but these categories are not adapted to Latin America.

1:56:57.560,1:57:00.660
But we in Europe,

1:57:00.660,1:57:05.940
we cannot do without the right-left split,

1:57:05.940,1:57:10.640
because it is still symbolically important.

1:57:10.640,1:57:18.120
The left is still linked to the ideas of equality  and social justice,

1:57:18.120,1:57:22.040
and the right is still linked to the idea of liberty.

1:57:22.040,1:57:29.220
There's a wonderful book by Norberto Bobbio in which he wonders what is the meaning of the right and the left.

1:57:29.220,1:57:35.900
We've always linked certain values to the left,

1:57:35.900,1:57:40.440
like the enhancement of democracy or social justice.

1:57:40.440,1:57:47.380
I insist on the fact that I support the idea of a leftwing populism,

1:57:47.380,1:57:52.320
a populism that aims at radicalizing democracy,

1:57:52.320,1:57:55.100
but there are other forms of populism.

1:57:55.100,1:58:03.080
I think Marine Le Pen is a populist, she builds a people and gives it a voice,

1:58:03.080,1:58:13.680
but she does not defend the democratic values of equality and liberty.

1:58:13.680,1:58:20.820
So it's important to understand that the division cannot be set down on the traditional right-left split.

1:58:20.820,1:58:31.760
The left is like a sociological basis that can be represented by different people.

1:58:31.760,1:58:41.540
This comes from the development of financial capitalism that,

1:58:41.540,1:58:52.000
along with many negative consequences of course,

1:58:52.000,1:59:04.940
enables many different categories of people to identify with what Jean-Luc calls a citizens' project

1:59:04.940,1:59:07.360
or what I call a leftwing populism,

1:59:07.360,1:59:18.420
because contrary to the Fordist age, in which workers in assembly line jobs

1:59:18.420,1:59:22.300
were the only ones who felt capitalist domination,

1:59:22.300,1:59:28.260
well today, we all feel capitalist domination one way or another,

1:59:28.260,1:59:34.340
even those who have nothing to do with companies,

1:59:34.340,1:59:40.660
because we all feel the effects of privatization policies, for instance.

1:59:40.660,1:59:51.080
So today there is the possibility of rallying different categories around values of emancipation and social justice,

1:59:51.080,1:59:58.600
categories that were considered to be the voters of the right.

1:59:58.600,2:00:03.680
There is something that I've always found interesting in Podemos,

2:00:03.680,2:00:09.640
when they say that they don't want to speak to traditional leftwing voters only.

2:00:09.640,2:00:18.100
They also want to convince people who have always voted for the rightwing  Partido Popular.

2:00:18.100,2:00:28.780
To them, these voters are also under the domination of capitalism, and Podemos wants to convince them.

2:00:28.780,2:00:41.580
In some way, neoliberal policies enlarge the constituency of a leftwing project,

2:00:41.580,2:00:55.000
which explains why we should not use the traditional right-left split,

2:00:55.000,2:01:04.500
but this split remains important for making a distinction between different types of populism.

2:01:04.500,2:01:19.980
Another aspect of leftwing populism concerns this need to set down a chain of equivalences between heterogeneous demands.

2:01:19.980,2:01:26.840
We discussed this issue in "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy",

2:01:26.840,2:01:34.120
when we said that the left needed to rephrase the socialist project around the idea of the radicalization of democracy

2:01:34.120,2:01:40.640
because the demands of workers are not the only one that matter for an emancipation project,

2:01:40.640,2:01:52.860
there are also feminist, environmental, anti-racist or gay right demands.

2:01:52.860,2:01:59.620
This is what we meant when we talked about the need to set down a chain of equivalences between these demands.

2:01:59.620,2:02:05.600
Setting down this chain is what we mean by building a people,

2:02:05.600,2:02:14.560
which is why traditional Marxist categories are no longer efficient for the development of an emancipation project,

2:02:14.560,2:02:24.740
because many democratic demands do not stem from relations of production.

2:02:24.740,2:02:29.900
It is important to articulate these heterogeneous demands

2:02:29.900,2:02:38.240
and it is important to build this movement...

2:02:38.240,2:02:45.420
I prefer the idea of a movement because I consider leftwing populism should not be a political party.

2:02:45.420,2:02:49.360
It could include a party-like aspect,

2:02:49.360,2:02:57.200
but it should connect social movements with the party-like aspect,

2:02:57.200,2:03:08.040
because many of these demands that should be articulated through this people, this progressive, collective 'we',

2:03:08.040,2:03:11.580
are expressed through social movements,

2:03:11.580,2:03:20.640
and it would not be possible to connect them through a political party.

2:03:20.640,2:03:31.060
We should find a way to conect these social movements to a more traditional organization,

2:03:31.060,2:03:40.540
and on this point I disagree with many lefties who advocate an horizontal organization

2:03:40.540,2:03:46.680
and who think society can be transformed through social movements only,

2:03:46.680,2:03:54.500
that think that everything that is concerned with the transformation of the state is necessarily a bad thing.

2:03:54.500,2:04:06.240
This is why I disagree with Tony Negri and Michael Hardt's idea of what they call exodus, desertion,

2:04:06.240,2:04:11.000
a notion that refuses everything that is concerned with transforming the state, instutions,

2:04:11.000,2:04:16.300
everything that looks like a party or a union.

2:04:16.300,2:04:20.720
They want to build a new society outside institutions.

2:04:20.720,2:04:26.000
I rather share Gramsci's idea of positional warfare.

2:04:26.000,2:04:32.400
We need to get involved in institutions and transform them from within,

2:04:32.400,2:04:36.180
we need to seize power and transform the state,

2:04:36.180,2:04:44.420
as Syriza or Podemos tried or try to transform the state.

2:04:44.420,2:04:52.140
This strategy is different from the social democrat strategy

2:04:52.140,2:04:57.360
that seeks to enter institutions to reproduce them, not to transform them.

2:04:57.360,2:05:09.640
On the other hand, there is the radical left that either refuses to use institutions or wants to destroy them.

2:05:09.640,2:05:21.760
A leftwing populist strategy seeks to seize power in order to transform society

2:05:21.760,2:05:33.320
but this entails a party-like aspect, Podemos calls it an electoral war engine, as well as social movements.

2:05:33.320,2:05:35.720
This is really important to me.

2:05:35.720,2:05:41.600
Leftwing populism is a new way of conceiving the left,

2:05:41.600,2:05:48.020
that neither looks like social democracy nor the far left.

2:05:48.020,2:06:06.960
This is why I fight, theorically of course, for a new way of conceiving the left

2:06:06.960,2:06:15.920
that leaves the traditional political splits behind.

2:06:15.920,2:06:20.540
CV: What a considerable programme! Jean-Luc?

2:06:20.540,2:06:29.120
JLM: You give us a lot to think about! I won't be able to tackle all these issues...

2:06:29.120,2:06:37.560
First, I will try to call your attention to...

2:06:37.560,2:06:41.260
The grass is always greener on the other side,

2:06:41.260,2:06:48.240
but I would like to remind you that the Podemos experience has nothing to do with Syriza,

2:06:48.240,2:06:51.640
and that the Syriza experience has nothing to do with Die Linke, and so on.

2:06:51.640,2:06:56.460
The evolution of ideas is embodied by political movements.

2:06:56.460,2:07:01.160
It is a bit late, but if you will,

2:07:01.160,2:07:04.720
I could tell you some other time about how things evolved

2:07:04.720,2:07:12.060
from Europe to Latin America, from Latin America back to Europe, from the emergence of Podemos

2:07:12.060,2:07:24.560
to the necrosis of the French Left Front, that turned into a tiny cartel of parties

2:07:24.560,2:07:38.620
and to the original political project that we are trying to build, based on a new type of theory

2:07:38.620,2:07:43.040
that I developed in my books "The Age of the People" and "Choosing Rebeliousness".

2:07:43.040,2:07:50.160
But this new theory that I developed does not leave the tools of the past behind.

2:07:50.160,2:07:54.000
I disagree with Chantal on this point,

2:07:54.000,2:08:02.060
because I built my theory on Marxism, and I consider myself a sort of Marxian,

2:08:02.060,2:08:05.240
meaning the tools of historical materialism...

2:08:05.240,2:08:11.540
What is Marxism? A friend of mine had a witty way of answering this question.

2:08:11.540,2:08:16.800
He said Marxism was a production of the Moscow Institute of Historical Materialism.

2:08:16.800,2:08:26.480
He meant that some people had built a fixed doctrine based on very different texts,

2:08:26.480,2:08:32.200
but to me, Marxism explains history through the use of historical materialism,

2:08:32.200,2:08:37.120
that used laws that need to be updated.

2:08:37.120,2:08:42.540
For instance Marxist determinism is necessarily that of Simon Laplace,

2:08:42.540,2:08:45.600
and it does not leave room for uncertainty.

2:08:45.600,2:08:48.760
Nowadays, we understand determinism as a probabilist idea.

2:08:48.760,2:08:52.960
I will spare you a lecture, but this entails various consequences,

2:08:52.960,2:08:59.740
like the importance of the minor incident I was speaking of, that linear determinism does not take into account.

2:08:59.740,2:09:09.060
All these philosophical notions had a role in the development of the theory of the citizens' revolution,

2:09:09.060,2:09:11.940
and we drew them from concrete experiences.

2:09:11.940,2:09:19.460
So, the issue of setting down a division is always concerned with consciousness.

2:09:19.460,2:09:23.080
The salaried class did not disappear, the salariat even spread to society as a whole

2:09:23.080,2:09:28.000
in an economic model that leaves no room for entire sectors of society.

2:09:28.000,2:09:31.600
These sectors are either learning,

2:09:31.600,2:09:39.920
for the reason that the educational standards of today's society are higher than they have ever been,

2:09:39.920,2:09:42.440
or because these sectors were dismissed from production

2:09:42.440,2:09:47.980
because productivity gains decreased the required volume of work

2:09:47.980,2:09:53.940
that has been disorderly distributed between the unemployed and the exploited that work more and more and more.

2:09:53.940,2:10:01.440
The very structure of society sets down a division.

2:10:01.440,2:10:04.880
The division between 'we' and 'they' is an objective reality.

2:10:04.880,2:10:07.620
'They' are the oligarchs and the caste

2:10:07.620,2:10:17.440
and 'we' are all those who do not belong to this category, those with ever-disparate social statuses,

2:10:17.440,2:10:22.200
disparate because the system itself individualized employment contracts.

2:10:22.200,2:10:30.040
Therefore job insecurity, the multiplication of social status, uberization brought about the explosion of the former working class,

2:10:30.040,2:10:34.740
but don't tell me it was easier to build a 'we' before because the working class was more homogeneous.

2:10:34.740,2:10:40.260
It was not! And those who say it was were not activists in this period!

2:10:40.260,2:10:44.000
Creating class consciousness was a very difficult thing to do.

2:10:44.000,2:10:46.920
CM: That's not what I'm saying.

2:10:46.920,2:10:51.740
JLM: I didn't say you did, I'm not blaming you. CM: I want this to be clear...

2:10:51.740,2:10:56.100
JLM: I know Chantal, but I'm not blaming you, I'm blaming those who used to say...

2:10:56.100,2:11:01.000
Back when I was at the Socialist Party – let us all join in a common loathing –

2:11:01.000,2:11:08.260
some people used to tell me "You know, pal, society changed, the situation is different". Well the former situation was very difficult too!

2:11:08.260,2:11:11.780
I was a political activist before, and when we were supporting the Common Programme

2:11:11.780,2:11:17.280
among a working class that was half-dominated by rightwing networks, well it was very difficult!

2:11:17.280,2:11:22.620
Because of paternalism, we were a minority in the Peugeot factory of Montbéliard,

2:11:22.620,2:11:26.600
although workers there were all doing assembly-line works in harsh conditions.

2:11:26.600,2:11:33.860
Class consciousness was the result of a self-definition, which leads us back to the previous discussion.

2:11:33.860,2:11:36.860
People should now self-define themselves.

2:11:36.860,2:11:41.160
You won't convince them if you merely base your argument on their social condition,

2:11:41.160,2:11:50.220
because social conditions are very disparate. The consciousness of one's particular condition does not produce a 'we'.

2:11:50.220,2:11:56.480
Which is why we are trying to tackle the issue from another angle, that of the main contradiction of our age,

2:11:56.480,2:12:01.560
the contradiction that leads us to the destruction of our ecosystem.

2:12:01.560,2:12:08.900
If productivist capitalism, which does not produce any norm of self-organization, destroys our ecosystem,

2:12:08.900,2:12:12.640
then there is a human, anticapitalist public interest.

2:12:12.640,2:12:19.260
For the first time, progressives and anticapitalists can appropriate the notion of human public interest,

2:12:19.260,2:12:24.720
that includes the largest amount of categories in society that can join the 'we' against 'they'.

2:12:24.720,2:12:31.120
'They' are the poisoners, the developers of productivist agriculture, those who destroy the planet,

2:12:31.120,2:12:35.100
while we are those who just want to live and have simple pleasures,

2:12:35.100,2:12:38.640
those who are absolutely opposed to what 'they' want to do with us.

2:12:38.640,2:12:45.740
There is no contradiction in setting down a division with the tools of the past

2:12:45.740,2:12:49.520
but the division cannot be set along the same lines.

2:12:49.520,2:12:51.520
It does not mean that the realities they described no longer exist,

2:12:51.520,2:12:55.560
it means that they have become so common to almost everyone that it no longer makes any sense.

2:12:55.560,2:13:05.460
This is why I suggest to build new hegemonies through the idea of environmental planning for instance,

2:13:05.460,2:13:13.020
or the idea of an eco-humanism that reshapes  progressive ideals into the human public interest.

2:13:13.020,2:13:20.220
This leads me to my conclusion.

2:13:20.220,2:13:24.000
The left and the right are a reality, it's obvious.

2:13:24.000,2:13:27.780
But their reality does not come from the words used to describe them, these words are corrupted.

2:13:27.780,2:13:33.280
People think with words, and as long as they think that the left means Hollande they cannot think.

2:13:33.280,2:13:37.300
And when someone presents himself as the left, people say

2:13:37.300,2:13:40.840
"Wait a minute, the other guy is also from the left. Are you both from the left?"

2:13:40.840,2:13:43.920
Then you have to answer the other guy is from the right, but what are you then, the real left?

2:13:43.920,2:13:54.860
We discuss this issue a lot with Podemos. If we accept their lateralization, we will be called the far left in the blink of an eye,

2:13:54.860,2:14:00.420
there will be the left, the real left, the false left, the far left, the not really lefty left... Anyway!

2:14:00.420,2:14:04.740
The issue is not about negating or refusing the word 'left',

2:14:04.740,2:14:09.320
nor is it about some sort of hazy fantasy about going beyond the left.

2:14:09.320,2:14:12.900
The issue is about rebuilding the left's roots,

2:14:12.900,2:14:18.720
or, more precisely, about rebuilding  the roots of what was called called the left.

2:14:18.720,2:14:21.900
This root is made of two ideas: sovereignty and citizenship.

2:14:21.900,2:14:27.880
We need to grab this root and make it grow towards the idea of the human public interest,

2:14:27.880,2:14:30.680
and then the left can be built again.

2:14:30.680,2:14:37.080
Here we might disagree, but the issue is not only about rethinking the left intellectually,

2:14:37.080,2:14:42.920
it is also about building it again concretely. This is why my strategy, sorry but I need to talk about it at some point,

2:14:42.920,2:14:46.240
is not about gathering the left, I oppose this idea.

2:14:46.240,2:14:51.100
Of course this strategy is ambiguous. I want to gather lefties together, but not only!

2:14:51.100,2:14:54.620
Of course I want to gather lefties together! CM: We agree on this point.

2:14:54.620,2:14:57.840
JLM: Yes, I know, but I'm not arguing with you, I'm arguing with my general.

2:14:57.840,2:15:00.580
CM: But you just said we might disagree on this point.

2:15:00.580,2:15:03.460
JLM: Ok then, we agree, it's a good thing.

2:15:03.460,2:15:06.860
I'm serious, I don't want to start a fight, I have enough disputes with other people!

2:15:06.860,2:15:10.280
I mean I don't want to start a fight with my friends.

2:15:10.280,2:15:17.580
Anyway, I cannot say I want to gather 'the left' because that would mean making an alliance with the Socialist Party,

2:15:17.580,2:15:19.580
and that's precisely what I don't want to do.

2:15:19.580,2:15:26.180
This is the difficulty of real, everyday struggle. So what is my strategy?

2:15:26.180,2:15:30.540
It is exactly what you described, meaning the crystalization of heterogeneous demands,

2:15:30.540,2:15:33.360
and I use the expression of uniting the people,

2:15:33.360,2:15:36.380
and this is not the same as gathering the left.

2:15:36.380,2:15:40.180
It means rebuilding the left through the union of the people around its aspirations.

2:15:40.180,2:15:46.420
Carefully choosing our words is of the utmost importance, I totally agree with you.

2:15:46.420,2:15:51.520
If I ever say that I want to gather the left, well let me tell you that the battle is already lost.

2:15:51.520,2:15:54.600
If I do so, people will not understand I want to gather progressives together,

2:15:54.600,2:15:58.720
they will understand that I want to make an alliance with schemers and they'll think I'm like all the others.

2:15:58.720,2:16:03.640
You see, our problem is that they stole the words we used.

2:16:03.640,2:16:08.800
Therefore, we need to create new words all the time in order to create a 'we'.

2:16:08.800,2:16:12.460
If we say 'left', people understand 'Socialist Party'

2:16:12.460,2:16:15.860
If we say 'uniting the people', people understand something else,

2:16:15.860,2:16:20.220
for instance, when I take the subway, because I do take the subway, there is always someone who tells me

2:16:20.220,2:16:23.120
"Oh you are doing the same as we do"

2:16:23.120,2:16:28.640
so I answer "What do you mean by 'as we do'?", "Well, us, you know..." He means normal people.

2:16:28.640,2:16:34.120
That's what Chantal means by populism,

2:16:34.120,2:16:38.800
for this guy, normal people are those who take the subway, and not the others.

2:16:38.800,2:16:44.040
I don't know what he thinks about people who do not take the subway, because some of them are with us,

2:16:44.040,2:16:46.120
but that's the idea.

2:16:46.120,2:16:48.320
So this was my conclusion.

2:16:48.320,2:16:55.380
If there was one thing that I'd like to ask to people who are here tonight,

2:16:55.380,2:17:02.320
it would be that you take into account the fact that we do not improvise, and if we do, it is in the artistic sense,

2:17:02.320,2:17:06.860
meaning that ideas we have turn into action.

2:17:06.860,2:17:10.560
But a movement like 'La France Insoumise'

2:17:10.560,2:17:13.800
or the idea of the age of the people

2:17:13.800,2:17:20.180
all stem from the theory that we built based on the concrete revolutionary experiences,

2:17:20.180,2:17:24.880
and the constituent assembly is my... I mean our revolutionary strategy.

2:17:24.880,2:17:30.320
It will enable us to give birth to the people as a body politic through educational conflictuality,

2:17:30.320,2:17:38.600
meaning that the constituent assembly will be opposed to particular political interests

2:17:38.600,2:17:42.720
and will be in favour of the public interest expressed by the 'we'.

2:17:42.720,2:17:47.360
We are lucky to be 'the people', and this cannot be translated in any other language.

2:17:47.360,2:17:51.160
In France, people use to say "If everyone was doing the same as you do, what a mess it would be!".

2:17:51.160,2:17:54.740
This implies that what cannot be done by everyone is not a good thing.

2:17:54.740,2:17:58.940
The root of the French people is equality, and this goes far back in the past,

2:17:58.940,2:18:02.600
and we owe that to our glorious ancestors and their beautiful mottos.

2:18:02.600,2:18:05.120
We need to use this egalitarian history.

2:18:05.120,2:18:11.940
CM: Do you mean the Gauls? JLM: Gauls were in no way egalitarian people, they are really not a role model!

2:18:11.940,2:18:15.720
CM: This was a joke about what Nicolas Sarkozy said about the ancestors of the French.

2:18:15.720,2:18:17.900
CV: So... Do you have something to say Chantal?

2:18:17.900,2:18:25.720
CM: I agree with the idea of uniting the people in order to rebuild the left.

2:18:25.720,2:18:32.200
[Applauds] CV: I think we can thank both our guests

2:18:32.200,2:18:38.120
whose debate was very interesting.

2:18:38.120,2:18:47.880
Organizing this debate was not easy, because it covered many different intellectual and theoratical issues.

2:18:47.880,2:18:54.000
We saw that philosophy can sometimes help us change the world as Jean-Luc said later.

2:18:54.000,2:19:01.000
I hope you enjoyed. This was the first time that Chantal and Jean-Luc had a debate in France

2:19:01.000,2:19:08.000
and I think you enjoyed their ideas and the theory they developed

2:19:08.000,2:19:15.940
as well as the relation between Chantal'sidea of populism and Jean-Luc's idea of uniting the people,

2:19:15.940,2:19:28.680
that do not always match on every issue, but the idea was to show the main points and the differences of their theory.

2:19:28.680,2:19:36.580
Maybe we will organize another debate in 2017

2:19:36.580,2:19:41.680
when the people will be mobilized and active, when it will have seize power,

2:19:41.680,2:19:47.300
we will be able to see the concrete application of their populist theory.

2:19:47.300,2:19:52.740
Anyway, thank you everyone, sorry for being behind schedule.

2:19:52.740,2:19:58.860
The Mémoire des luttes association was pleased to welcome you her, I must say that we are sorry

2:19:58.860,2:20:04.940
that we had could not welcome everyone who wanted to come tonight

2:20:04.940,2:20:10.420
because many people wanted to come.

2:20:10.420,2:20:15.860
Before we leave, you should know that we shot a video of the debate

2:20:15.860,2:20:24.220
that will be broadcast on the website of the association and on Jean-Luc's Youtube channel.

2:20:24.220,2:20:38.860
I don't know when but it will be broadcast on the media of the people.

2:20:38.860,2:20:40.860
Good night!
