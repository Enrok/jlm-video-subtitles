*Please check the English subtitles Project tab (https://github.com/jlm2017/jlm-video-subtitles/projects/1).*
Feel free to add any comments on cards/issues!

- **Wanna check existing subtitles?** Go to this point: https://github.com/jlm2017/jlm-video-subtitles/blob/master/README.md#correct--proofread-subitted-subtitles

## Process
### Create new subtitles
#### Which video to choose?
If some videos (with [subtitles] in the title) **are listed in the ```Draft``` column**, you can choose one and assign yourself to it.
If **they aren't any videos** to do, or **you've began a particular one**, please follow this process:
  - Create an issue (https://github.com/jlm2017/jlm-video-subtitles/issues/new), using this model: https://github.com/jlm2017/jlm-video-subtitles/issues/1
  - Assign yourself to it
  - Set appropriate flags on it
  - Go to the project page (https://github.com/jlm2017/jlm-video-subtitles/projects/1)
  - Click on Add cards, it opens a panel containing your issue
  - Drag and drop your issue in the Draft column
  - You're done, congratulations!

#### Writing subtitles
When you **begin to write** subtitles, **move the card** from the ```Draft``` column to the ```Redaction in progress``` column.

#### First subtitles version, waiting for proofreading
Once you have **finished**, **move the card** from ```Redaction in progress``` column to the ```Correction in progress``` column.
At this step, **please contact someone** by commenting the issue with a @someone to ask for a **correction/proofreading**.

#### Correction done, waiting for JLM validation
When the correction is done, **move the card** from the ```Correction in progress``` column to ```Waiting for JLM validation```. You can **ask to @LucileDT** to send a tweet at JLM (by commenting your issue), the JLM's team will quickly validate your work. 

#### Publication of your subtitles
